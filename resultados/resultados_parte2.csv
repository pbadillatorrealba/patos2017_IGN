An evil empire has decided to eliminate all of its political opposition and you must stop them. You can play as warrior, mage, or cleric; each character type has advantages and disadvantages.

As you progresses through levels, your character gains experience and new abilities, and you can also store power-ups for later use thanks to a nifty inventory system.

The team's leader (Cyclops) shows up, as does the teleporter from another dimension named Spiral. Each character contains an extensive list of moves that start out simple but get progressively more difficult to perform. Careful timing and button combinations execute the moves, so plenty of practice is required. There is a Two-Player mode that lets you and a friend go head-to-head in a battle to the death. The backgrounds are all locations inspired from the cartoon and feature many of the well-known headquarters and bases.

POINT BLANK sends you out on a series of intoxicating missions that vary in degree of difficulty and ammunition: you may find yourself in a room full of gunmen and you only have enough bullets to activate the code on a keypad door lock; or you'll have all the ammo you could ever want, but you're in a room filled with equal parts gunmen and innocent bystanders. These challenges are incredibly fun and will have you thumbing the ""continue"" button until you either succeed at a challenge or get a red flag.

7.8,Good,"Duke Nukem takes on a third-person perspective in DUKE NUKEM: Time to Kill. Time-traveling aliens threaten Earth's future, and Duke must travel through time to ancient Rome, the Wild West, and a futuristic Space Age to stop them. One there, he must run, jump, climb, swim, and shoot his way to finding the colored crystals that are the key to defeating the aliens. Before finding the crystals, use pipe bombs, gatling guns, and shotguns to put the bad guys out of commission. Luckily, you won't miss a second of the action because Duke becomes transparent when he would otherwise be obscuring the carnage. You also won't miss a single time-twisting alien by using the look function to aim your weapons. If blowing away the aliens is no fun, challenge your friends to a death match in the two-player mode.

A unique element of the game is its fluid turn system. Instead of fixed phases for movement and combat, players can resolve attacks at any point in their turn, reacting in a more realistic way to situations as they develop. The game has good graphics, although the main map can be difficult to navigate. Units are represented by ""counters"" using standard military symbols, which beginners may find confusing.

Five of your fellow Gain agents have defected, and it's your duty to track them down and exterminate them. In the hallowed tradition of classic games like SPY VS. SPY and BOMBERMAN, you run through complex levels laying bomb-traps, shooting, kicking, and collecting power-ups in an attempt to take out your opponents. TRAP GUNNER's addictive gameplay is easy to pick up and enjoy but difficult to master. You'll need to develop clever strategies and utilize quick reflexes to disarm traps and emerge victorious. Six different bombs are selectable: Switch Detonators (activated via the X button), Regular (which explode when triggered by other bombs), Gas (timed, poisonous gas emitters), Pitfall, Force Panel, and Mine. Watch in safe satisfaction as your enemies trip a series of exploding combos and are blasted into oblivion. More than 30 maps are available, and stages include Story mode and two-player Versus.

8.6,Great,"Planetary battles is what

is all about. Based on the novel and comic book series by the same name,

follows the adventures of a daring group of pilots led by Luke Skywalker and (later on) Wedge Antilles. In Rogue, players take on the role of Luke Skywalker (and Wedge in the last mission) and set out to fight the evil Empire in more than 15 missions in familiar and new Star Wars locations. The battles all take place in extensive 3D worlds on planetary surfaces (there are no space battles) ranging from the hot sands of Tatooine to the spice mines of Kessel and even the oceans of the Mon Calamari. In addition to the 15 regular missions, there are also a few hidden ones that have to be unlocked.","Factor 5, LucasArts",Flight,8.8,Great,N64 PC,47.99 USD,LucasArts,T for Teen,Animated Violence,"http://www.ign.com/games/star-fox-64/n64-419,http://www.ign.com/games/top-gun-64/n64-10094,http://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-battle-for-naboo/n64-10461,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/star-fox-64/n64-419,http://www.ign.com/games/diddy-kong-racing/n64-2146,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933","December 7, 1998",http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153964p1.html,Star Wars: Rogue Squadron,http://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-rogue-squadron/n64-3964
8.2,Great,"The name says it all in this challenging puzzle game that has you navigating through vast environments as a beach ball. Make your way through the dozens of dizzying 3D mazes as you try to find the keys that will let you escape from each level. Traveling high above the ground you'll face obstacles such as fire patches, dangerous captivators, ice patches, spikes (not a great thing when you're a beach ball), and lethargy pills that distort the screen. Time, however, is your real enemy; an hourglass sits in the corner of each screen and if it runs out you do, too. There are bonus items to help you get through each round such as fruit, coins, and gems. An unusually versatile beach ball, you actually have the ability to jump (which comes in handy if you're trying to avoid the aforementioned spikes). You can play in either Arcade mode, or Time Trial, an option that has you racing against a one-minute time limit.",Game Design Sweden,Puzzle,8.9,Great,PS PSP PS3,24.99 USD,Psygnosis,E for Everyone,No Descriptors,"http://www.ign.com/games/one-piece-mansion/ps-488410,http://www.ign.com/games/wheel-of-fortune-1998/ps-10374,http://www.ign.com/games/shanghai-true-valor/ps-11799,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/hot-shots-golf-2/ps-13666,http://www.ign.com/games/one-piece-mansion/ps-488410,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673","December 1, 1998",http://psx.ign.com/articles/153/153993p1.html,Roll Away,http://www.ign.com/games/roll-away/ps-3993
7.1,Good,"The classic game of answers and questions, JEOPARDY! has arrived for the PlayStation. Every aspect of the show has been recreated, and you'll see it as the camera pans and zooms across a perfect rendering of the television studio. Just like on TV, Alex Trebek provides encouragement and support for all of the players in full-motion video sequences. With over 3,500 different answers all of them are read by JEOPARDY! announcer Johnny Gilbert there are plenty of challenges to keep the player engaged. But don't think the categories are dumbed down because this is a videogame every single answer could be on the show. When a category appears, it is recorded on a memory card to help prevent questions from repeating.
