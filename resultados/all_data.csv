Buster Bros. Collection	http://www.ign.com/games/buster-bros-collection/ps-759	Late '80s arcade games often had unusual premises but very addictive gameplay; BUSTER BROTHERS was one of those games. Simply put, large balloons threatened the safety of the character at the bottom of the screen. His only chance at survival was to throw a spiked chain in the air to pop the balloon. However, this was no ordinary inflated piece of rubber: after being hit by a spike, the balloon would split into smaller, faster balloons that were harder to avoid. Luckily, the videogame gods made things easier by dropping power-ups from the sky. All of this excitement and action is brought to the PlayStation with BUSTER BROTHERS COLLECTION. Included in the package is the original BUSTER BROTHERS arcade game along with SUPER BUSTER BROTHERS and the never-released BUSTER BUDDIES.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS Arcade PS3 PSP	6.0	Okay	7.7	Good	Capcom	Mitchell Corporation	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	May 26, 1997	25.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150759p1.html

Nanotek Warrior	http://www.ign.com/games/nanotek-warrior/ps-748	NANOTEK WARRIOR is a shooter that uses a behind the back perspective, which was relatively new for shooters of this type when the game was released (1997).

You'll come across a plethora of special weapons as you travel along the tube, as well as extra energy for your shields. If you're feeling particularly daring, you can even jump off the tube, if only for a second, to either fire at something in the air or to jump over an obstacle. At the end of each stage you'll come to a special boss level, where you orbit around a big enemy and go one-on-one.

Of course, no MORTAL KOMBAT game would be complete without all the fatalities and other staples of the MK franchise, and TRILOGY is no exception."	http://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-alpha/ps-181,http://www.ign.com/games/digimon-world-2/ps-16355,http://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3/ps-2294,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Fighting	PS N64 Saturn G.com PC RZone	6.0	Okay	7.8	Good	Williams Entertainment Inc.

Pitball	http://www.ign.com/games/pitball/ps-308	Get ready for some fast sports action in PITBALL. The game takes place in arenas located on several planets scattered throughout a fictional galaxy. Each team's competitors fight for control of the energized Pitball, using attack moves both complex and simple. Once the Pitball is in possession, the player attempts to shoot it into the goal, which is a tiny hole at the top of the pit wall. With either fast but weak or slow yet strong teams to match your style of play, the variety of maneuvers and attacks results in some very exciting matches. The Season mode is great: using a combination of in-the-pit and behind-the-scenes maneuvering, it allows players to take a team and guide it from the bottom to the top. It's even possible to let the computer play the matches, which comes in handy when you'd prefer to rest your tired thumbs and focus on management.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS	5.0	Mediocre	6.2	Okay	Accolade	Accolade	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	Oct 29, 1996	49.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150308p1.html

Tempest X3: An Inter-Galactic Battle Zone	http://www.ign.com/games/tempest-x3-an-inter-galactic-battle-zone/ps-40	TEMPEST was huge arcade hit in the 1980s. Vector graphics combined with a rotating control knob and easy to learn (but hard to master) gameplay made it a game that sucked the allowance out of your pocket one quarter at a time. Now that same game has come to the PlayStation with TEMPEST X3. In addition to the Classic Tempest, there are two other modes of play. In Tempest X, there are warp gates that will get you through certain levels, and an AI-controlled droid that helps you through some of the tougher spots. There is also Tempest Duel, which pits you against a friend and an unlimited supply of enemies. All of the action takes place to a new techno soundtrack that puts you in the right mood for the fast action that ensues . If you lost your allowance to a TEMPEST cabinet, then you should run out and get TEMPEST X3.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS	8.0	Great	8.3	Great	Interplay	High Voltage Software	null	null	Nov 1, 1996	59.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150040p1.html

In this mission-based game, your goal is to make your way through every nook and cranny of the world, shooting first and asking questions later. Gamers can shoot in any direction while running in another one, giving the game a real run-and-gun feel. The D-pad is used to control the character's movements and the four action buttons serve to control which direction the character is aiming. The game has many unique enemies and plenty of huge bosses with relatively decent AI, so shooting them will be more than a matter of pulling the trigger; you'll actually have to study them a little bit to pick up their habits or patterns. If you're in the mood for some serious carnage, then PROJECT OVERKILL is just what you need.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS	5.0	Mediocre	6.4	Okay	Konami	Konami	M for Mature	Animated Blood and Gore, Animated Violence	Aug 28, 1996	34.9 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150169p1.html

Crypt Killer	http://www.ign.com/games/crypt-killer/ps-734	Light-gun games have been rather sparse on the Playstation, but CRYPT KILLERS tries to remedy that. The game starts with an ancient legend: an ancient civilization existed before the more recent civilizations of the Mayans and Egyptians, but that civilization suddenly disappeared. Some believe that aliens visited the ancient civilization and left behind crystals that allowed people to travel through time. These crystals became known as the Eyes of Guidance. The search for the crystals has heated up since more information has been discovered; you know the locations of the eyes and want to claim them. Move through six levels of catacombs, tombs, tunnels, and rivers while blasting skeletons, spiders, zombies, and rats. If using the standard controller makes life too difficult, plug in any Playstation compatible light gun and let the good times roll.

A grand addition to the family, TETRISPHERE eclipses its predecessors, challenging you to explode your way to the center of an enormous sphere. Choose from a long list of robot characters each with different personality traits that includes Wheels, Jak, Rocket, Gear, Turbine, and Stomp. The 3D gameplay takes place over 300 different levels, each more challenging than the last. The main objective is to pull the right combination of pieces out of a giant, rotating ball forcing an explosion that will further open the gap to the ball's core. Each time you reach the center of the ball, you advance to the next level. If you get mixed up or take too much time figuring out how to make the combo, a block gets added to the outer part of the ball, making your job that much more difficult. Not only that, but three such mistakes will end your game entirely! With excellent audio-visual presentation and gameplay that's doubly worthy of the TETRIS name, this game is already a classic.	http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-puzzle-challenge/n64-14801,http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-move-2-arcade-edition/n64-3606,http://www.ign.com/games/the-new-tetris/n64-10072,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Puzzle	N64	8.0	Great	8.0	Great	Nintendo	H2O Entertainment	K-A for No Rating	null	Aug. 11, 1997	6 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/150/150420p1.html

Pitfall 3D	http://www.ign.com/games/pitfall-3d/ps-2101	In PITFALL 3D you're going to be taking Pitfall Harry (voiced by ARMY OF DARKNESS star Bruce Campbell) across levels built using the classic PITFALL formula. In other words, you'll see signature items like the swinging vines, nasty scorpions, gold bars, and plenty of jumping action. Everything is well placed in new environments, but some conventions, like the swinging action, are still pretty fresh among the new platformers. The story sees Harry entering another dimension that's being enslaved by an evil being called The Scourge, who's changing all the world's magical energy from good to bad.  PITFALL 3D is considered by many to be an excellent update of a classic game. Can you save the world from The Scourge? The only way to find out is to play PITFALL 3D: Beyond the Jungle.	http://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot/ps-603,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot-warped/ps-3919,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot-2-cortex-strikes-back/ps-2037,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Platformer	PS GBC	7.0	Good	7.2	Good	Activision	Activision	T for Teen	Animated Violence	Mar 26, 1998	35.9 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152101p1.html

Based on the groundbreaking coin-operated favorite, HARD DRIVIN', this update lives up to the reputation of the original. Experience eight unique racecars as you take to six different tracks, searching for alternate routes in order to get the best of your foes. Virtually everything is customizable here: you can select the total number of laps in each race, the number of opponents you'll face, and whether the course should be standard, reversed, or mirrored. Not only that, you choose weather conditions, difficulty level, and which gauges you'll be able to see you might rather have an uncluttered screen than access to your RPMs. All of these options certainly give the game as high a replay value as possible, and the obstacles are always different adding even more to the enjoyment factor. The game also has a Dual-Player mode in which you square off head-to-head with a friend (or enemy).

Luckily, you are armed with a battalion of tank prototypes. While there are only three different types to choose from at the beginning, the number of choices will grow to 12 as more tanks are discovered throughout the game. Play takes place in either the Arcade or Quest modes. Arcade has the player fighting through 10 levels of driving and shooting action, where players can pick up new weapons like laser beams, plasma cannons, and missiles. Between each mission, there is the opportunity to change tanks. Quest mode plays the same way, except the player is not given the opportunity to switch vehicles and must drive the same tank through all of the levels. Do you have what it takes to defeat General Storm?

Multi Racing Championship	http://www.ign.com/games/multi-racing-championship/n64-1916	Featuring up to 10 chooseable cars (many which open up later in the game), and three courses (plus mirror courses), Multi Racing Championship's biggest draw is the splendidly realistic feel of the cars themselves and the well designed courses on which they drive. The cars range from 4X4s, trucks, and off-road racers to slick street cars, Lamborghinis and the like. While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course. Each car handles terrains differently, and some, like the trucks, obviously handle the off-roads better than others, but you can also modify your street car to handle dirst roads well, too.	http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/diddy-kong-racing/n64-2146,http://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-x/n64-418,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Racing	N64	6.4	Okay	6.5	Okay	Ocean	Imagineer	E for Everyone	null	September 5, 1997	5.95 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/151/151916p1.html

Choose from six different modes of play: Story, Versus, Slash, Training, POV, and Link. Select any of the six skilled warriors: Red Shadow, Tatsumi, Mikado, Black Lotus, Utsusemi, and Kannuki. Equip them with one of the eight ancient swords and weapons: Katana, Rapier, Naginata, Sledgehammer, Nodachi, Long Sword, Saber, or Broadsword. Combat takes place throughout an old Japanese castle, where you can move around at will and make your stand wherever you wish. The game's Story mode encourages fighting with honor; certain endings are unavailable if you have dishonored yourself throughout the course of the game. If you strike an opponent while they are climbing or on the ground is considered dishonorable. BUSHIDO BLADE's fighting system is a little different from most fighting games as well, as a single, well-placed blow can bring instant death to an adversary.	http://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-alpha/ps-181,http://www.ign.com/games/digimon-world-2/ps-16355,http://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3/ps-2294,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Fighting	PS	8.7	Great	8.2	Great	Sony Computer Entertainment	Square	T for Teen	Animated Blood, Animated Violence	Oct 25, 1997	44.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150464p1.html

Lode Runner: The Legend Returns	http://www.ign.com/games/lode-runner-the-legend-returns/ps-2298	LODE RUNNER is one of the oldest games in videogame history. It was originally released on the Apple II, back when computers were just a little bit more than glorified calculators.

Players take control of a lone runner who must navigate a series of platforms and ladders trying to collect all of the gold and move on to the next level. However, there are red runners who are out to stop you. Your only defense is a flame-thrower that will create holes in the platforms for the bad guys to fall into. As an added bonus, the game has a Construction mode, which allows you to create your own screen layouts and place gold and enemies where you see fit.

Saga Frontier	http://www.ign.com/games/saga-frontier/ps-2114	Saga Frontier breaks the mold of traditional role-playing games. Thanks to the Free Scenario System, the player has the opportunity to complete seven different quests, each with a unique lead character and story. However, all of the stories take place in the same world, and most of the stories intersect at various points. This particular arrangement allows the player unprecedented freedom. In addition, the battle system also takes a different approach: rather than conserving hit points (they regenerate between fights), players must conserve weapon points, which are used to unleash powerful attacks. Multiple attacks can be combined to create even more devastating combinations. Try to discover the links between all of the characters and the greater evil guiding all of the events in Saga Frontier.	http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	RPG	PS	7.0	Good	7.2	Good	Sony Computer Entertainment	Square	T for Teen	Mild Language	Mar 31, 1998	49.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152114p1.html

NHL Breakaway '98	http://www.ign.com/games/nhl-breakaway-98/ps-1863	NHL BREAKAWAY '98 offers one of the most original features ever to appear in a hockey game: the Momentum-Based Checking System. Players can actually out-skate and out-muscle each other, depending on a player's size and speed. For example, some players may be smaller but are fast, while others may be slow but possess the strength and size to do all the dirty work. For instance, if a large, fast player such as Eric Lindros gets moving at a high rate of speed, the power behind his check is greater than what someone like Pierre Turgeon could produce. The game sports most of the usual play modes, and you can always take on a friend in the Versus mode. If you edit a player, the name and number will appear on the player's back, which is a great feature that lets you put yourself in the game.	http://www.ign.com/games/ncaa-football-2001/ps-14657,http://www.ign.com/games/nhl-2001/ps-14658,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/ps-14304,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Sports	PS N64 Saturn PC	7.0	Good	6.4	Okay	Acclaim Entertainment	Acclaim Entertainment	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	Winter 1997	50.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/151/151863p1.html

Diddy Kong Racing	http://www.ign.com/games/diddy-kong-racing/n64-2146	DIDDY KONG RACING may have the Technicolor fantasy backgrounds and cute characters (like Timber and Conker) from a child's daydream, but this is no playground. Only consistently good and strategic play will win and advance your chosen cutie. There are 30 courses over five different happy-time worlds, all part of a giant Overworld. Racing is only part of the player's challenges, which include boss characters to defeat, stacks of silver coins to collect, multicolor balloons to snag, and yellow floating bananas to gobble up. After achieving success in a series of straight races, you then have to complete missions handed out by the pesky bosses. Each mission is harder, and after you manage to collect enough trophies for them you still have to race cute opponents in a sequential series of races to complete and win the Trophy Race. But there's help in the form of cool new weapons and vehicles, including a plane and a hovercraft. The game is beautifully rendered in all its bubble gum glory, and play is enhanced by the development of Realtime Dynamic Animation, which enables polygons to be more flexible and cover more area of Overworld.	http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-x/n64-418,http://www.ign.com/games/rush-2-extreme-racing-usa/n64-3852,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/star-fox-64/n64-419,http://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-rogue-squadron/n64-3964,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Racing	N64 NDS	8.4	Great	8.4	Great	Nintendo, Rare	Rare	E for Everyone	null	Nov. 24, 1997	47.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/152/152146p1.html

Who would so recklessly take the source of the Yoshis' power? Baby Bowser, that's who.

X-Men: Children of the Atom	http://www.ign.com/games/x-men-children-of-the-atom/ps-2331	X-MEN: Children of the Atom for the PlayStation is a port of the original arcade hit. The game features 2D animation, much like the art in the comic books that thrust the X-Men into the limelight. Many of the characters from the comics appear, from the popular to the obscure. The team's leader (Cyclops) shows up, as does the teleporter from another dimension named Spiral. Each character contains an extensive list of moves that start out simple but get progressively more difficult to perform. Careful timing and button combinations execute the moves, so plenty of practice is required. There is a Two-Player mode that lets you and a friend go head-to-head in a battle to the death. The backgrounds are all locations inspired from the cartoon and feature many of the well-known headquarters and bases. X-MEN: Children of the Atom fits the classic Capcom mold, yet has an identity all to itself.	http://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-alpha/ps-181,http://www.ign.com/games/digimon-world-2/ps-16355,http://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3/ps-2294,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Fighting	PS Arcade Saturn PC	3.5	Awful	6.8	Okay	Acclaim Entertainment	Probe, Capcom	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	March 3, 1996	19.77 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152331p1.html

The game is very, very, very fast. There are more than 12 weapons types, including all kinds of missiles, flash bombs, mines, laser tripwires and even a flame thrower.

The same folks that brought you TUROK have turned their attentions to the gridiron and have brought great graphics, realistic action, and lots of options to the sport. With full licenses from the NFL and its athletes, the game has all of the teams and players, plus perfect replications of logos and stadiums. You can play an individual game or a full season in which your stats will be kept in nine different categories. Whichever mode you're playing in, day-of-game variables include weather, injuries, and penalties, and you can even select from six different camera angles while playing. There's also a Historical mode that lets you tap into classic games of yesteryear. If all that's not enough to keep you going, you can actually design your own players to throw into the fray! Just to assure that the artificial intelligence was high and the gameplay realistic, the developers coaxed Brett Favre into designing some of the plays and advising them on the finer points of the sport.

Final Fantasy Tactics	http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics/ps-26	FINAL FANTASY TACTICS' strategic battle system is a twist on the turn-based system of the other FINAL FANTASY titles. You begin as a noble squire named Ramza in a time of confusion and war in the land of Ivalice. Your best friend, a commoner named Delita, is caught in the middle of the struggle between nobles and commoners, and this affects you; so begins your long quest for the truth. Much of the story in TACTICS is told on the battlefield or as a direct result of battles, which take place on a three-dimensional grid that can be rotated 360 degrees. You select your battle party, put them on the field, and determine their every move. Between battles, you can explore towns and forests on the world map, acquire new items, and undertake side quests. TACTICS has plenty of nostalgia for FINAL FANTASY veterans, as well as a new play style to keep newcomers interested.	http://www.ign.com/games/age-of-empires/ps-20051961,http://www.ign.com/games/command-and-conquer-red-alert/ps-2198,http://www.ign.com/games/nectaris-military-madness-1999/ps-10159,http://www.ign.com/games/alundra/ps-2018,http://www.ign.com/games/star-ocean-the-second-story/ps-4057,http://www.ign.com/games/blood-omen-legacy-of-kain/ps-2024,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Turn-Based, Strategy	PS PSP Android iPhone PSP PS3	8.5	Great	8.9	Great	Sony Computer Entertainment, Square	Square	T for Teen	Mild Language, Violence	January 1998	14.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150026p1.html
Monopoly [1998]	http://www.ign.com/games/monopoly-1998/ps-2280	Monopoly for the PlayStation introduces a whole new generation to the classic board game. The object of the game is simple: bankrupt your opponents. The gameplay calls for you to roll the dice and circle the board, buy or trade properties, build houses and hotels, and charge rent when your opponents happen to land on them. The more expensive properties are more desirable, as the rent is proportionately higher. You must also avoid the long arm of the law and jail time, which causes you to lose a turn and potential profit. From the look of the board itself, to the wheelbarrow, race car, and dog used as pieces, to the color of the deeds, every detail is accounted for in the PlayStation version. You can play with up to eight players with a multi-tap, or go it alone against the computer.	http://www.ign.com/games/chessmaster-ii/ps-11800,http://www.ign.com/games/saikyo-toudai-shogi/ps-26158,http://www.ign.com/games/mahjong-mahjong/ps-165597,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Board	PS	3.0	Awful	5.3	Mediocre	Hasbro Interactive	Gremlin Interactive Limited	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	Jan 23, 1998	27.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152280p1.html

The cities are huge with room to maneuver; you'll enjoy the free 360-degree movement this game offers. However, it'll require more strategy than just blowing stuff up. You'll have to keep track of your weapons, fuel, and ammo because nothing is unlimited. AUTO DESTRUCT will give you hours of gameplay, due to its wide variety of challenging missions. There are a total of 25 of them, each seemingly different than the next. You'll encounter various search-and-destroy missions, escorting tasks, defending levels, and races to the death.

Enter a deceptively delicate world torn apart by age-old family conflicts as you search, explore, and call on every ounce of intuition you can muster. The successful structure of the first installment is once again in place, as you roam the mostly desolate island, scouring its rooms for portals, clues, and secret chambers. Each world you enter is a superb blend of delicate beauty and nail-biting suspense, and each riddle is more difficult than the last. The few beings you do encounter are as reclusive and mysterious as the game itself and there's an array of pathways at your disposal each leading to a unique and stunning fate. With groundbreaking graphics and sound, over three hours of astonishing animation, and a story that would make Dickens weep, RIVEN is a truly engrossing masterwork.	http://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill/ps-3982,http://www.ign.com/games/dino-crisis/ps-11235,http://www.ign.com/games/oddworld-abes-oddysee/ps-2094,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Adventure	PS Mac iPhone Saturn PC iPad Android PDA	7.0	Good	7.8	Good	Acclaim Entertainment	Cyan Worlds, Inc.

The player chooses a Micro Machine -- which range from racing cars and offroad trucks to big rigs and ice cream trucks -- and races it over a series of weird and wonderful, differently-themed courses. A breakfast table mightn't sound like a thrilling place to race, but when you're a piddly Micro Machine, all of a sudden spilled milk becomes a lake, splotches of syrup become deadly sticky pools and spoons, bowls and bottles become building-sized obstacles. Another course is set on a series of school desks. Pencils, erasers and books form impassable obstacles, and the rulers connecting the desks form thin, perilous roads whose lack of guard rails means a deadly fall is only a spaz twitch away.	http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-1998/ps-2226,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-2/ps-11426,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Racing	PS PC GBC N64	8.7	Great	8.0	Great	Midway  Games	Codemasters	E for Everyone	Mild Animated Violence	January 1998	51.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152220p1.html

There is also a very cool Sniper mode, which allows you to get up close and personal with your enemies, all the while keeping a safe distance away. The soundtrack is done by one of the best companies in the business, Tommy Tallarico Studios, who opted for a cinematic score. MDK is considered one of the best action adventure games to ever grace the PlayStation.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS PC Mac	8.0	Great	7.8	Good	Playmates	Neversoft Entertainment	T for Teen	Animated Blood, Animated Violence	Nov 21, 1997	21.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152076p1.html

The game disc actually reads a small portion of any CD you put into your PlayStation, and uses that data to generate a monster. Some CDs will yield giant dragons, while others will give you smaller and less threatening beasts. After you create a monster, you then must train it in the ways of the monster pugilist. You control every aspect of the monster's training, from what it eats to what attributes it will be focus on improving. Monsters can be frozen for later use, or even combined with other monsters to form hybrid creatures that possess different abilities. The point of the game is to become the champion monster breeder, and there are rankings that give you an idea as to where you stand. Most of MONSTER RANCHER consists of point-and-click menus, with the exception of the fights themselves. There are two different options for fighting: you can let the computer control your beast or you can take manual control of it yourself.	http://www.ign.com/games/sim-theme-park/ps-13684,http://www.ign.com/games/monster-rancher-2/ps-11227,http://www.ign.com/games/harvest-moon-for-girls/ps-569712,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Simulation	PS	9.0	Amazing	8.3	Great	Tecmo	Tecmo	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	November 1997	26.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152180p1.html

The game allows you to play as two different characters, each with different sidekicks and weapons. The game plays differently for each character, almost giving you a two-for-one feeling. If you play as X, your experience will be very similar to the other MEGA MAN X games, while if you choose Zero, the story is pretty much the same, but you have to change your approach in battles and traversing the terrain.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS PC PSP Saturn PS3 Vita	7.0	Good	8.4	Great	Capcom	Capcom	E for Everyone	Animated Blood, Animated Violence	November 17, 1997	26.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152083p1.html

Parappa The Rapper	http://www.ign.com/games/parappa-the-rapper/ps-490	PARAPPA THE RAPPER is about a rapping dog named PaRappa and his friends PJ Berri, Sunny Funny, and Katy Kat. Appearing almost more like a cartoon than a game, it follows PaRappa's fascination with Sunny Funny, a sunflower. PaRappa will go through several rites of passage learning courage, getting a driving license, and going on dates. The crux of PaRappa lies in the rapping segments of the game. To get to the next stage, you must reproduce the raps of a number of teachers. Rapping is accomplished by pressing the correct buttons at the correct moments, all in time to the music. This may sound easy, and it is at first, but it gets more and more difficult as the game goes on. With impressive visuals, a memorable soundtrack, and a cast of oddball characters, PARAPPA THE RAPPER is a PlayStation classic.	http://www.ign.com/games/guitar-freaks/ps-12563,http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-groove-2/ps-11939,http://www.ign.com/games/mtv-music-generator/ps-13748,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Music	PS PS4 PSP	9.0	Amazing	8.7	Great	Sony Computer Entertainment, SCEI	Nana On-Sha, Interlink	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	November 1997	44.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150490p1.html

You accomplish this by setting traps to destroy the nefarious cubes. Red traps will destroy one block at a time; destroy a green cube and earn a green trap, which destroy the blocks in a three-by-three area. Beware of the black cubes, though, because destroying one will remove part of the platform you are standing on. If you don't destroy the cubes fast enough, they roll to your location and push you off the edge. Once all of the cubes are gone, you will advance to the next level, where the platform is wider and the cubes move much faster. For the social types out there, there is a two-player mode where challengers take on eight different stages to see who can earn the best score.

Offering up some of the best graphics home gaming has ever seen, WETRIX is pure puzzle-solving mayhem. The premise seems simple enough: move and stack falling pieces to trap rainwater beneath a 3D surface. Of course, if you don't build your dams just right, you'll mess the whole thing up and cause unbelievable chaos: drop a piece in the wrong spot, and you'll inadvertently poke a hole in the delicate crust of your environment; stack the pieces to high, and prepare for a massive earthquake. You have access to bombs and mines that will help you level the landscape if things get messy, and you can use powerful fireballs to evaporate excess water if need be. Use ice cubes to freeze your reservoirs, and rainbows to melt them down again. The controls are very simple, but don't get too vexed if the game takes a few tries to master.

X-Men vs. Street Fighter	http://www.ign.com/games/x-men-vs-street-fighter/ps-39	X-MEN VS. STREET FIGHTER for the PlayStation is a port of the arcade game, with a few new twists thrown in to keep it interesting. Namely the team-up aspect has changed, along with some of the moves. This title combines two hugely popular franchises and pits them in battles that rival those seen in the X-MEN comic books. Each character can execute special moves either with a partner or solo, resulting in some devastating attacks that will leave your opponent reeling. Although the game is in 2D with sprite-based graphics, the animation is smooth and the fighting almost resembles a moving comic. The special attacks all look spectacular, often filling the screen with colors and explosions that must be seen to be believed. The combo system may seem difficult to learn at first, but once it's mastered the possibilities are practically endless. X-MEN VS. STREET FIGHTER is an engrossing fighting game that can be played alone or with a friend, with classic characters ranging from Ryu to Rogue.	http://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-alpha/ps-181,http://www.ign.com/games/digimon-world-2/ps-16355,http://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3/ps-2294,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Fighting	PS Arcade Saturn	6.0	Okay	7.6	Good	Capcom	Capcom	T for Teen	Animated Violence	June 11, 1998	48.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150039p1.html

At first look, BUST-A-MOVE 2: Arcade Edition resembles nothing so much as a preschooler's game. The goal is to shoot different color bubbles up at a descending ceiling of bubbles; connect three of the same color and they vanish with a ""pop."" Things become more interesting when you have to select from three game modes. Pick between a Puzzle Game, where it's just you against the oncoming bubbles in a variety of clever patterns; Single-Player vs. Computer Player, where things get interesting because every time one of the increasingly odd cartoon opponents connects three or more bubbles, they pop and then appear on your screen; or Single-Player vs. Human Player, which is fun because while the computer plays with more precision, humans can be sneaky snakes who will send you over a batch of bubbles at the worst possible time."	http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-puzzle-challenge/n64-14801,http://www.ign.com/games/the-new-tetris/n64-10072,http://www.ign.com/games/sanrio-time-net-world/n64-10104,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Puzzle	N64 PS PC GB Saturn	8.0	Great	8.0	Great	Acclaim Entertainment	Probe	E for Everyone	null	May 20, 1998	60.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153606p1.html

Naturally, each corporation would like to control all of the former United States. Rather than wage war, these companies have developed flying, robotic, enhanced, armored, killing synthoids, or Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. These synthoids have weapons fused to their bodies, and have only one purpose: they must destroy the synthoids of every other corporation to allow the their company to dominate. These battles are not for the squeamish, as fighters have been known to lose limbs. All the fighting takes place on land and in the air. Do you have the guts and the skill to take on the F.R.E.A.K.S.?	http://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-alpha/ps-181,http://www.ign.com/games/digimon-world-2/ps-16355,http://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3/ps-2294,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Fighting	PS PC Arcade N64	6.5	Okay	5.8	Mediocre	Midway  Games	Saffire	M for Mature	Animated Blood and Gore, Animated Violence	Feb 23, 1998	28.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152318p1.html
Bio F.R.E.A.K.S.	http://www.ign.com/games/bio-freaks/n64-1924	Midway Entertainment's MORTAL KOMBAT popularized a style of arcade fighting that will probably last forever. Each time a new game comes out it, tries to do that vaunted series one better. For example, BIO F.R.E.A.K.S. features a cast of genetically mutated warriors who have their weapons surgically bound to their bodies. And there's enough hard-hitting action, carnage, and wanton destruction to keep even the most die-hard fans happy and coming back for more. The mega-corporations that own and operate the world in the future each have a BIO F.R.E.A.K.S. (Biological Flying Robotic Enhanced Armored Killing Synthoids) warrior protecting their territory. When a fighter wins a battle, his corporation takes over the other's territory which does NOT go over well back in the home office. The level of action escalates until you think you can't take it anymore but somehow you manage! This game is not for the meek or for game fans that still need their mothers to cut their meat for them.	http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Action	N64 PC Arcade PS	6.4	Okay	6.1	Okay	Midway  Games	Saffire	M for Mature	Blood, Gore, Animated Violence	May 19, 1998	38.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/151/151924p1.html

Drive an authentic 1997 Grand Prix season on 17 tracks.

As Goemon and his friends, explore ancient towns, haunted castles, and mysterious bamboo groves in polygonal 3D and solve puzzles to advance. The game never takes itself seriously -- whether you're talking to the ghost of a wise man in a Hamlet-inspired seance (complete with laugh track) or smashing tiny mechanical armies in your Goemon Impact robot. The gameplay offers mainly platform jumping and exploration, but there are of course plenty adventure elements and you can talk to everyone and everything.	http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Action	N64	7.6	Good	8.6	Great	Konami	Konami OSA (KCEO)	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	Apr. 16, 1998	49.95 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/150/150608p1.html

If a mission calls for you to break roadblocks, a lightweight sports car is not a good idea; you'll want to steal a bus or a truck.

Deadly Arts	http://www.ign.com/games/deadly-arts/n64-2172	Konami delivers a frantically fun 3D fighting game for the Nintendo 64: DEADLY ARTS. In this beautifully rendered collection of backgrounds, you can face off against challenging opponents with your own virtual character, using the unique Create-a-Fighter option. You create your challenger by choosing from various body shapes, heights, hairstyles, and faces. Once your gladiator is ready, you pick one of the game's cool characters to fight against. As you defeat each opponent in the ring, you'll be able to learn moves from them, eventually piecing together the best moves from each of the other fighters. Or you can use the Tag mode, where you form a three-person team; you can switch characters at any time, but anyone you drop is out for the game. Use all the fighting skills you can master (like punch, kick, block and evade), and add to your arsenal as you learn new moves. Much like VIRTUA FIGHTER, all matches are determined by the tabulation of various scores not by low energy meaning every new hit or combo move matters.	http://www.ign.com/games/super-smash-bros/n64-10494,http://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-trilogy/n64-454,http://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-4/n64-1912,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Fighting	N64	3.2	Awful	5.7	Mediocre	Konami	Konami	T for Teen	Animated Violence	September 22, 1998	42.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/152/152172p1.html

It seems that the evil Sylvester T. Square and his robotic minions are responsible not only for the fire, but they've taken hostages as well. Guide Rosco through the towering inferno as you rescue the innocent, squelch the fire, knock off the robots, and stop old Square once and for all. There are 15 blazing levels of action to work through each more terrifying than the last. You'll need to watch out for a host of hazards including backdrafts, dangerous smoke, and electrical fires. With a dozen unique hazards in all, the robots are only the beginning of your problems! Of course, you'll have your share of special weapons and power-ups to help give you a boost: Water canisters, a Super Hose, food items, and CO2 cartridges are just a few of the items you'll have on hand. Just like any fire fighter worth his salt, Rosco always has his axe on hand too which comes in handy against menacing robots. Make sure to keep an eye on the temperature, too; if the heat gets too high, your game is over.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS	4.5	Bad	6.5	Okay	Psygnosis	Psygnosis	E for Everyone	Mild Animated Violence	Nov 2, 1998	24.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/160/160337p1.html

Essentially two separate systems, it is both a game and a scenario designer. Players have a high level of control over units, from company to corps level, with a wide array of command choices. A unique element of the game is its fluid turn system. Instead of fixed phases for movement and combat, players can resolve attacks at any point in their turn, reacting in a more realistic way to situations as they develop. The game has good graphics, although the main map can be difficult to navigate. Units are represented by ""counters"" using standard military symbols, which beginners may find confusing.

NHL '99	http://www.ign.com/games/ea-sports-mania-pack/n64-3970	EA signed up MBL Research to bring the classic 16-bit EA Sports hockey franchise to the N64.

With all due respect to both Eddie Murphy and MBL Research, NHL '99 took advantage of the N64's capabilities well enough to provide a robust and full hockey game regardless of the other drivel that had appeared on the N64 to that point. You had the full license, you had all of the arenas, you had all of the rules and regulations of hockey, of course. More than all of that however, you had the nonstop hockey action that had been missing from the N64 library.	http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/n64-14169,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf/n64-10628,http://www.ign.com/games/international-superstar-soccer-2000/n64-15240,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Sports	N64 PC PS PC Mac	8.8	Great	8.3	Great	Electronic Arts	MBL Research	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	Oct. 01, 1998	19.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153970p1.html

Gex: Enter the Gecko	http://www.ign.com/games/gex-64-enter-the-gecko/ps-2061	Rez is out to destroy the Television Realm, and only Gex the Gecko can save it. Unfortunately, Gex has retired, but a huge pile of cash from the government quickly changes his mind. You take control of Gex as he travels through 24 levels with themes that are parodies of television and movies. In each level, Gex must collect remote controls to open new areas and eventually fight the level boss. Throughout all of the levels, Gex (voiced by HBO comedian Dana Gould) rattles off a variety of wise cracks to lighten the mood of the game. Many of the comments are keyed to the theme of the area Gex is exploring. Will Gex be able to defeat Rez? Will he be able to get over his television addiction? Find the answers to these questions by playing GEX: Enter the Gecko.	http://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot/ps-603,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot-warped/ps-3919,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot-2-cortex-strikes-back/ps-2037,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Platformer	PS Vita N64 GBC PSP PC PS3	8.0	Great	7.8	Good	Midway  Games	Crystal Dynamics	E for Everyone	Animated Violence, Comic Mischief, Mild Language	Feb 24, 1998	47.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152061p1.html
Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit	http://www.ign.com/games/need-for-speed-iii-hot-pursuit/ps-2231	NEED FOR SPEED 3 offers five different modes including Single Race, Tournament, Knockout, Practice, and Hot Pursuit. Hot Pursuit is one of the more fun modes you're likely to see in a racing game, as it gives you the chance to go on the lam and lead the cops on a wild goose chase. Pay attention, though, because the police have some tricks up their sleeves, namely tire spikes and roadblocks. Tournament is the deepest mode, as it lets you enter a series of racing tours in order to prove your dominance. There are eight cars and eight tracks in the game, although not all of them are available from the get-go. But you can unlock the new cars and tracks by performing well with the initial cars and tracks. Some of the well-known cars you can expect to drive are Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Chevrolet.	http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-1998/ps-2226,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-2/ps-11426,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Racing	PS PC	8.0	Great	8.2	Great	Electronic Arts	Electronic Arts	E for Everyone	null	Late March 1998	26.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152231p1.html
Moto Racer 2	http://www.ign.com/games/moto-racer-2/ps-3898	EA Sports is back with more high performance motorcycle racing in MOTO RACER 2. MOTO RACER 2 is essentially two motorcycle-racing games in one: you can race dirt or street bikes. The game has 32 tracks, some of which put you in the dirt with huge jumps that are good for trick jumping, while others are street courses that allow you to go full throttle and approach insanely high speeds. Also included is a 3D track editor, which allows you to increase or decrease elevation and make jumps and dangerous curves. If you're looking for multiplayer action, you can tear it up on the track against a friend in the Versus mode. Whether you like the challenge of dirt tracks or the wide-open expanses of street racing, MOTO RACER 2 has something for every motorcycle-racing fan.	http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-1998/ps-2226,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-2/ps-11426,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Racing	PS PC	8.7	Great	7.6	Good	Electronic Arts	Delphine	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	Fall 1998	34.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/153/153898p1.html
Circuit Breakers [1998]	http://www.ign.com/games/circuit-breakers/ps-3943	CIRCUIT BREAKERS is new kind of racing game. Rather than racing on road courses, the tracks are more like roller coaster rides, with hairpin turns and drastic drops. And, like a roller coaster, there are no walls to keep you on the track. So, missing a turn will throw you into the abyss and cost you valuable time. Your ability to stay on course is tested in three play modes: World Series, Battle, and Time Trial. In World Series, try to beat seven opponents in 16 different races. Battle mode allows you to challenge three friends to a race. If you find the track too crowded, tackle the Time Trial mode and create new world records for each track. In all modes, the courses are littered with power ups including rocket boosters, shrinkers, and oil slicks that give the player a competitive edge. If you're tired of the same old racing games, give CIRCUIT BREAKERS a try.	http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-1998/ps-2226,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-2/ps-11426,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Racing	PS	8.0	Great	8.2	Great	Mindscape	Supersonic Software	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	Sep 2, 1998	48.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/153/153943p1.html

Innovative gameplay and creative one-player missions have taken the place of the multiplayer functionality many have come to expect and take for granted in Bomberman titles. Sure, they may have changed a classic a little, but the one thing that the designers didn't go cheap on is the bombs. The intuitive controls allow the player to increase the number of bombs thrown at one time (from one to four) as well as alter the diameter of the blast radius. Power-ups also make available such fun accessories as the Freeze Bomb, Salt Bomb, and Remote Control Bombs, as well as the ever-popular Power Glove. The action takes place over five distinctive worlds and the designers have given BOMBERMAN HERO some new toys, like the BomberCopter, BomberMarine, BomberJet, and BomberSlider to help him combat the dangers waiting ahead.	http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-64/n64-606,http://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-64/n64-607,http://www.ign.com/games/banjo-kazooie/n64-1922,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Platformer	N64 Wii	6.0	Okay	7.2	Good	Nintendo	Hudson Soft	E for Everyone	Mild Animated Violence	September 01, 1998	19.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153781p1.html

From mufflers to clutches to paint jobs, you can customize your car to fit your driving taste and style. The game offers two distinct modes: Arcade mode and Gran Turismo (Simulation) Mode. The arcade mode enables you to race exhibitions in which you can choose a fixed number of cars and tracks. In Gran Turismo mode, you start out with a set amount of cash, pass license tests to qualify for different events, and head to the races. The higher the events, the more cash you can get to upgrade your car. In addition to a mad amount of cash, if you take first place in an event, you also win a special car. And that's basically the whole idea: to race, to win cars, and to get rich.	http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-2/ps-11426,http://www.ign.com/games/r4-ridge-racer-type-4/ps-10354,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Racing	PS	9.5	Amazing	9.0	Amazing	Sony Computer Entertainment	Sony Computer Entertainment	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	March 1998	24.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152226p1.html

FIFA '99	http://www.ign.com/games/fifa-99/ps-10166	Instead of trying to recreate the World Cup tournament, FIFA 99 squarely focuses on the the European league, with more than 250 soccer teams battling for the cup. Don't worry, EA didn't forget about the rest of the World. You can select plenty of international teams, from Argentina to Yugoslavia, as well as US and Brazilian league teams. FIFA 99 also dishes up a much more varied lineup of game modes, including a European Dream league and Cup Creation modes. In addition to its wider variety of modes, EA wisely included a Player Edit and a Team Edit function, so you can keep your teams up to date (you need a memory pak to save, of course). Like in FIFA 98, you can change face maps, give your players names, adjust attributes, and so forth. However, there are still no separate height and weight attributes for players.	http://www.ign.com/games/ncaa-football-2001/ps-14657,http://www.ign.com/games/nhl-2001/ps-14658,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/ps-14304,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Sports	PS PC N64	9.0	Amazing	7.9	Good	Electronic Arts	Electronic Arts	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	Nov 25, 1998	45.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/160/160166p1.html

Motorhead	http://www.ign.com/games/motorhead/ps-10435	The future of racing is here, and it's called MOTORHEAD. This game allows you to hop in one of 10 streamlined racers and test your skills on eight obstacle-filled courses that wind through urban, desert, and seaside terrain. Play modes include the standard Time Attack, Single Race, League, and Head-to-Head competition found in any decent racing game. One unique feature of MOTORHEAD is that you can choose between 30 or 60 frames per second. Choosing 60fps gives the game a polished look, but you're limited to a three-car field. While going with 30fps hurts in the visual department, it does expand the field to seven cars; you'll probably want to experiment with both to figure out which one works best for you.. This futuristic racer has impressive visuals and cleverly designed vehicles that help put you in a futuristic state of mind. So if you're in the mood for a fast and fun racing experience, get your hands on MOTORHEAD.	http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-1998/ps-2226,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-2/ps-11426,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Racing	PS PSP PC PS3 PC	5.0	Mediocre	7.6	Good	Fox Interactive	Gremlin Interactive Limited	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	Nov 30, 1998	26.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/160/160435p1.html

DRILLER's Arcade mode requires you to burrow to the bottom of either a 2500- or 5000-foot passage. By facing a direction, Mr. Driller will drill through the block next to him, causing all like-colored blocks touching it to crumble as well. Three obstacles gravity, Mr. Driller's air supply, and the insidious X blocks make this harder than it sounds. Two additional modes, Survival and Time Attack, add to the replay value. MR.

FIFA 99 also dishes up a much more varied lineup of game modes, including a European Dream league and Cup Creation modes. In addition to its wider variety of modes, EA wisely included a Player Edit and a Team Edit function, so you can keep your teams up to date (you need a memory pak to save, of course). Like in FIFA 98, you can change face maps, give your players names, adjust attributes, and so forth.

Asteroids	http://www.ign.com/games/asteroids/pc-10495	They said it couldn't be done, but they were wrong: a new and improved Asteroids that is just as addictive as the original. The classic shooter has been converted into a 3D space shooter with tons of features, like mind-blowing 3D graphics, innovative cutscenes, and intense special effects. Another improvement over the original is the dynamic weapon arsenal: laser nets, repulser shields, and shockwaves to name a few.

One way to counter this is the barrel roll maneuver, which is a quick and effective way to avoid unexpected hurdles on the tracks. In the beginning, you drive a pretty unimpressive racer. However, if you beat the competition and place in the top three, your reward is the chance to upgrade your car. Be merciless and steal the losing racers' special features, such as engine and armor upgrades, special attack abilities, and enhancing cosmetic features for the car. You have 13 different racer body styles and nine tracks to choose from. The cartoony racers zip through city streets, ice caves, and a volcano, and with the Track Create mode, you can design the wildest track you can imagine. When you toss four-player racing into the fray, the fun quadruples as the action intensifies and the losers are utterly humiliated.	http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/diddy-kong-racing/n64-2146,http://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-x/n64-418,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Racing	N64	6.0	Okay	7.1	Good	THQ	Takara	E for Everyone	Mild Animated Violence	Feb. 10, 1999	58.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/152/152325p1.html

South Park	http://www.ign.com/games/south-park/n64-10075	When a comet almost collides with Earth, a posse of bizarre turkeys and evil aliens lands in South Park, and the four foul-mouthed grade-schoolers are, of course, going to have to rescue everyone. Switch back and forth between the characters with the touch of a button, as you use yellow snowballs, sponge-dart guns, toilet plungers, and more to squelch the strange attack and restore peace to the sleepy mountain town.

Based on the hit cartoon, SOUTH PARK actually uses custom speech from stars Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Isaac Hayes to keep the faithful masses happy, and adds a creative storyline that falls right in line with what you'd expect from the show. The 3D animation is a definite update on the cartoon, but the animation is so good, you won't even blink at the difference.

FIFA '99	http://www.ign.com/games/fifa-99/n64-10065	Instead of trying to recreate the World Cup tournament, FIFA 99 squarely focuses on the the European league, with more than 250 soccer teams battling for the cup.

Like in FIFA 98, you can change face maps, give your players names, adjust attributes, and so forth.

Wheel of Fortune [1998]	http://www.ign.com/games/wheel-of-fortune-1998/ps-10374	Do you want to buy a vowel? That's the question that WHEEL OF FORTUNE for the PlayStation based on the popular television game show asks players. The game features 3D graphics that realistically portray the actual set used for the show, with impressive lighting effects and a panning camera. The gameplay remains exactly the same as on TV. Up to three people can play at once, guessing letters of a particular phrase, location, or title, then winning money by spinning a wheel with dollar amounts on it. The show's co-host, Vanna White, appears in digitized video clips and performs the same duties that she does on the show. There are over 2,000 different puzzles, enough to keep any player busy for quite a while. Each game can be played within a specified time limit for games as long as the show, or just a few quick puzzles if you need a quick fix.  WHEEL OF FORTUNE for the PlayStation brings the game to an interactive form that replicates the show perfectly and is guaranteed fun for any puzzle-game lover.	http://www.ign.com/games/one-piece-mansion/ps-488410,http://www.ign.com/games/shanghai-true-valor/ps-11799,http://www.ign.com/games/intelligent-qube/ps-2199,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Puzzle	PS	8.0	Great	6.6	Okay	Hasbro Interactive	Artech Studios	E for Everyone	null	December 15, 1998	28.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/160/160374p1.html

Use flamethrowers, plasma bursts, mini-shockwave mortars, and many other weapons as you battle through eight action packed levels by yourself or with a friend. For those who like a little more strategy, play the Precinct Assault mode, in which both players (you can challenge the machine or another human) start with bases and construct combat units.

Tetris 64	http://www.ign.com/games/tetris-64/n64-4081	If it wasn't for the simple presentation and sound, Tetris 64 (aka Bio Tetris) would have been the clear winner of the Nintendo 64 puzzle wars. But even if it can't compete with the slick presentation and score of The New Tetris, Tetris 64 eclipses them all with a better four-player mode and much more gameplay variety. To round off the whole package, this oddball title is compatible with a Bio Sensor that uses your heart rate to either slow down or speed up the gameplay (depending on whether you want to relax or get excited). The game also includes some alternate Tetris variations featuring oversized and odd-shaped pieces. It's a bit hard to find nowadays, but if you see this game for a reasonable price in an import store, grab it before it's gone forever.	http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-puzzle-challenge/n64-14801,http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-move-2-arcade-edition/n64-3606,http://www.ign.com/games/the-new-tetris/n64-10072,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Puzzle	N64	8.4	Great	8.1	Great	Seta Corporation	Amtex	null	null	Japan Only	null	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/154/154081p1.html

Bust-A-Move '99	http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-move/n64-9937	"The learning curve on this addictive game isn't very steep, and most players will be having fun before they realize what's happening. The very basis of the game is that players must aim their bubble launcher (located at the bottom of the screen) up to the top of the screen toward other colored bubbles. If you match three or more of the same color, they'll vanish with a ""pop"" from playing field. Of course, the playing field marches down at a steady pace, so players will have to keep popping bubbles at a steady pace. When you play alone the bubbles you pop with your random bubble-emitting launcher vanish forever. If you're playing against an opponent, the popped bubbles will suddenly appear on their screen. Playing puzzles where you're the only player on the screen is enjoyable and a good way to practice, but the real fun begins when you play against a computer opponent or even better, a human opponent.

RollerCoaster Tycoon	http://www.ign.com/games/rollercoaster-tycoon/pc-10759	Roller Coaster Tycoon is all about getting people into your amusement park and emptying their pockets as you show them a good time. Park-goers come in with about $70 apiece, and you can set prices for general admission, for each different ride, and concessions like soda pop, hamburgers, park maps, and umbrellas. You can even charge people for using the rest rooms, but if you charge too much people will simply refuse to pay and make a mess outside. The rides themselves come in several flavors -- simple attractions like Ferris Wheels and Haunted Houses, and the more elaborate tracked rides, like log runs, miniature trains, monorails and of course roller coasters, that can be hand-designed to fit the local terrain or built from a default plan.	http://www.ign.com/games/civilization-beyond-earth/pc-20016115,http://www.ign.com/games/simcity/pc-128952,http://www.ign.com/games/civilization-beyond-earth-rising-tide/pc-20040683,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505	Economic, Simulation	PC Xbox	8.5	Great	8.6	Great	Hasbro Interactive	Microprose	E for Everyone	Mild Animated Violence	Mar 31, 1999	9.99 USD	http://pc.ign.com/articles/160/160759p1.html

Grand Theft Auto: London 1969	http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-london-1969/ps-11460	While expansion packs have been common on the PC, there has never been adequate technology for expansion disks on a console. GRAND THEFT AUTO: London 1969 changes that, as it's the first expansion pack to hit a console (you must own the original GRAND THEFT AUTO to play London 1969). As an expansion for the popular GRAND THEFT AUTO, London 1969 places you as a small time hood in swinging London. You must complete simple tasks as you move through the various levels of the British underworld. However, most of the tasks require pilfering automobiles. Keep in mind that you are in London, so the driver enters and exits on the right, and you'll want to stay on the left side of the road to avoid the coppers. All of the music and voices of the original game have been replaced with British rock and slang from the era to further thrust the player into 1969 London. Anyone who enjoyed the original GRAND THEFT AUTO should rush out and buy London 1969.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS PC	7.5	Good	7.0	Good	Rockstar  Games	Runecraft	M for Mature	Blood, Strong Language	April 1999	4.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161460p1.html

Pokemon Stadium 2 [Japanese Version]	http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-stadium-2-jp/n64-11758	"Second Pokemon Stadium game released in the Japanese market -- localized as Pokemon Stadium in the US. The original Pokemon Stadium (not available in the US) was released in August 1998 in Japan. It was a limited game that featured less than half of the 151 Game Boy creatures. It shipped with the 64GB Pak (Transfer Pak) packed in. Then Nintendo released this, better version of the game in April 1999, called Pokemon Stadium 2. The ""2"" in the title is a bit misleading, as it's actually just an expanded version of the original. PokeSta 2 features ALL 151 Pokemon, mini-games and more. In March 2000, Nintendo finally released Pokemon Stadium in the US. Although the game is just called Pokemon Stadium, it is actually an enhanced version of the Japanese Pokemon Stadium 2.

Super Smash Bros.	http://www.ign.com/games/super-smash-bros/n64-10494	Four-player action fighter, starring 12 Nintendo mascots, including Mario, Luigi, Fox, Link, Samus, Pikachu, Jigglypuff and Captain Falcon. All the action takes place on one screen, from a zoomed out third-person perspective more reminiscent of old-school platformers than traditional fighting games. The premise is as simple as the controls. Beat up you opponents and knock them off the fighting platform to score a point. The more damage your opponents sustain, the farther you can throw them. Apart from the quick, but explosive mayhem that ensues when more than one player has at it, the game manages to bring back many fond gaming memories by bombarding players with familiar items, power-ups and many classic tunes.	http://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-trilogy/n64-454,http://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-4/n64-1912,http://www.ign.com/games/killer-instinct-gold/n64-499,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Fighting	N64 Wii	8.5	Great	9.0	Amazing	Nintendo	HAL Laboratory	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	April 27, 1999	49.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/160/160494p1.html

Shanghai	http://www.ign.com/games/shanghai-809520/lynx-5876	"In 1986, the ageless Chinese game of mah-jongg was transformed into a computer puzzle challenge for the 20th century. This game became an instant hit, largely due to its simplicity: Players remove matching pairs of tiles from an organized heap, trying to remove as many tiles as possible. Now the game returns, in color, portable, and expanded, on the Atari Lynx. As in the original Shanghai, you are presented with 144 mah-jongg tiles arranged in an organized, three-dimensional heap. By selecting matching pairs of ""free"" tiles (tiles not blocked by other tiles to the left or right), you whittle down the pile, and ultimately -- if your strategy is wise -- clear the heap.

Starshot: Space Circus Fever	http://www.ign.com/games/starshot-space-circus-fever/n64-1953	Join Starshot and his fellow circus performers as they try to erase their debts and fend off their dastardly nemesis, Virtua Circus. Virtua Circus, it would seem, aims to kill off all smaller circuses, and monopolize the business. Starshot, an upstart juggler in the debt-riddled smaller troupe, takes off to visit far-away planets to get ideas for new acts; the hope being that these acts will help get the circus back in the black. Each land that Starshot visits is a vast level, with several missions and tons of interesting alien characters. As with most video games, our hero can jump, run, shoot, and fly. Unlike most video games, the object isn't necessarily to kill the enemies. Sometimes an enemy is more like a puzzle that needs to be solved than a scary thing that wants to kill you. Some of these puzzles are so intricate; they almost take on the roll of a series of mini-games with weapons or power-ups as rewards. With so many unique, detailed environments, crazy characters, and time-consuming challenges, STARSHOT: Space Circus Fever has all of the makings of a classic. Its artistry and original gaming concepts are simply fantastic.	http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Action	N64 PC	5.2	Mediocre	6.5	Okay	Infogrames	Infogrames	E for Everyone	Mild Animated Violence, Mild Language	June 24, 1999	57.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/151/151953p1.html

While many of the levels offer platform-jumping, vine-swinging fun, some of them recreate some of the action sequences from the movie. No matter where he is, Tarzan must collect the tokens and fruit that are scattered about. Collecting 100 tokens earns an extra life, and the fruit can be used to dispose of enemies.

Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt	http://www.ign.com/games/rugrats-scavenger-hunt/n64-3876	"In their big debut on the Nintendo 64, the favorite cartoon babies are about to get wrapped up in the scavenger hunt to end all scavenger hunts. Featuring three different board games, RUGRATS: Scavenger Hunt utilizes the animation and humor from the cartoon series, and melds it into an original game that has players traipsing through 3D worlds looking for hidden objects. In ""The Pirate Treasure Hunt,"" the babies travel underwater in search of items; ""Angelica's Temple of Gloom"" challenges players to find bits of Stu's broken Aztec statues before Angelica can; and ""Reptar Rally"" has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island. Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board). Don't get too worked up though, as each baby has an energy meter, and if it hits zero you'll have to take a nap."	http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-64/n64-606,http://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-64/n64-607,http://www.ign.com/games/banjo-kazooie/n64-1922,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Platformer	N64	3.7	Awful	4.5	Bad	THQ	Realtime Associates	E for Everyone	Comic Mischief	June 29, 1999	58.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153876p1.html

Apart from regular settings, which let you enjoy the slot machine gameplay with normal rules, there is also the more advanced Pro Stage that gives players access to machine settings, adding quick stops, different double-ups and higher bets. Place your bet, hit a button and stop the reels at the right time to win more credits. There are eight lines, A through H. Numbers next to the letters increase (to a maximum of 8) as bets on lines are made. When pictures are lined up, the total below one of the bonus categories found on the right side of the screen decreases.

When moving your character, the image of Leon somewhat jumps from place to place -- when he moves away from the camera, he is scaled appropriately to make it seem like he really is moving in three dimensions.

Fighting Steel	http://www.ign.com/games/fighting-steel/pc-12098	Strategy/war game. This is a battleship combat sim that recreates historical sea battles in the Atlantic and Pacific between 1939 and 1942. Some additional hypothetical battles are also included. Fighting Steel is set in real time and includes a 3D interface as well as map screens for plotting fleet course and for supplying orders. This interface, which is somewhat reminiscent of Jane's Fleet Command, makes the game a little more like a naval simulation than a full-fledged strategic war game, but this is a good blend of both worlds. The biggest downside to this style of 2D/3D interface is that it can be terribly confusing even to an experienced war gamer or simulation buff. Players need to have a little interest and understanding of both styles of gaming, or at least a lot of patience, just to get started.	http://www.ign.com/games/halo-wars-2/pc-20041132,http://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-remastered/pc-20066763,http://www.ign.com/games/rome-total-war-2/pc-136961,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505	Strategy	PC	7.0	Good	7.4	Good	Mindscape	Strategic Simulations, Inc.

Driver	http://www.ign.com/games/driver/ps-266	You are Tanner, a former racecar driver-turned-cop. Because of your past as a racer, you are sent on an undercover mission as a wheelman for hire in order to investigate the Castaldi crime family. The investigation will take you to Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York, but before you can get these cities, you must take a driving test and prove that you have the skills to be a wheelman. After passing the test, tackle the missions of the story mode, which has over 40 missions that involve picking up and dropping off items or pursuing and disabling other cars. One of the major obstacles to completing your goals is the cops; they don't know that you are undercover, and letting you pass would blow your cover.

Bust-A-Move Pocket	http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-move-deluxe/ngpc-12122	In this handheld adaptation of the classic puzzle game, there are four modes that all follow the same basic concept. Shoot colored bubbles from the bottom of the screen towards the top and try to align three of the same color to make them pop. Special bubble blocks, such as the Star Bubble or the Metal Bubble help or hinder you from achieving your goal. In Puzzle Mode, players try to clear the screen as quickly as possible, Vs-CPU is a battle against different computer opponents, Survivor is all about how long you can go without drowning in bubbles and Vs-Player has you go head-to-head against a human opponent via the link cable (you can also pick from three difficulty settings in this mode). Control of the bubble shooter is a cinch thanks to the NGP's nice thumb stick. B shoots, pushing left or right adjusts the degree, pushing up makes the shooter perpendicular and holding A while moving allows for more subtle adjustments.	http://www.ign.com/games/master-of-shogi/ngpc-11059,http://www.ign.com/games/puzzle-tsunagete-pon/ngpc-11804,http://www.ign.com/games/puyo-pop/ngpc-12970,http://www.ign.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-pocket-adventure/ngpc-12670,http://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1/ngpc-11051,http://www.ign.com/games/samurai-shodown-2-pocket-fighting-series/ngpc-12019	Puzzle	NGPC PSP	8.0	Great	8.2	Great	SNK [1978-2001]	SNK [1978-2001]	E for Everyone	null	May 1999	null	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162122p1.html

NFL Blitz 2000	http://www.ign.com/games/nfl-blitz-2000/dc-9981	Midway returns to their hit football game with NFL BLITZ 2000 for the Dreamcast. The game is an upgrade from the arcade version of NFL BLITZ ‘99. There are numerous additions that make the game more exciting: you can play with up to four players: two on defense, two on offense. You can also write your own plays and use them later on. The game is like a normal football game, but with much more speed and far fewer rules. The result is a fun (if unrealistic) look at the NFL. Every team is faithfully represented, as are the players. This new version adds an On Fire mode, which allows players that have caught three consecutive passes to gain a special unlimited Turbo feature. This lets the player run much faster than normal and gives the player a distinct advantage. Anyone who likes to recreate games with their favorite teams but doesn't like the rules that slow down gameplay, NFL BLITZ 2000 is the perfect solution!	http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/dc-14676,http://www.ign.com/games/world-series-baseball-2k1/dc-13023,http://www.ign.com/games/power-stone/dc-10637,http://www.ign.com/games/crazy-taxi/dc-12006,http://www.ign.com/games/ready-2-rumble-boxing/dc-11165,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967	Sports	DC PS N64 PC GBC	8.3	Great	7.8	Good	Midway  Games	Midway  Games	E for Everyone	Animated Violence, Mild Language	September 7, 1999	27.99 USD	http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/159/159981p1.html

Work with eight basic offensive formations and six defensive formations to put your own personal stamp on the game. You also have control over frequency of injuries, weather conditions, quarter lengths, and game speed. You can even program how the referees call the penalties!  Quarterback accuracy, blocking ability, and run or pass ratios it's all up to you.

As you make your way through the single-player game, you'll be invited to join one of two biker gangs, who can provide a degree of protection (at the very least, they won't kill you). Whether you choose a durable powerhouse or an agile motorbike, you'll love the high-octane crashes that give this game its title. Breathtaking animations take center stage, as the bikes skid out and the riders flip through the air like rag dolls in a warehouse explosion. The multiplayer options are not to be missed; as you try your hand at Lap Races, a Deathmatch, an inventive version of Tag, or some leisurely Pedestrian Hunting. Throw in music by such popular recording artists as the Mermen and Sugar Ray, and you've got a real classic.	http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/diddy-kong-racing/n64-2146,http://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-x/n64-418,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Racing	N64	7.8	Good	7.9	Good	THQ	Pacific Coast Power and Light (PC&L)	T for Teen	Animated Violence	September 22, 1999	66.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153966p1.html

As you win more races and buy more steeds, you will be able to breed the animals to create the perfect thoroughbred. If all of these options and decisions sound confusing, use the Practice mode to jump on a mount and ride around the track.

Disciples: Sacred Lands	http://www.ign.com/games/disciples-sacred-lands/pc-12718	Disciples is a turn-based fantasy strategy game that is clearly inspired by the Heroes Of Might & Magic series, and that is not a bad thing. Like Heroes, you have a town that you upgrade with new structures that give you access to new creatures. Like Heroes, you trot small groups around the map to claim resources and fight neutral monsters guarding treasures. Like Heroes, while all this is happening, some tough computer opponents (with quite good AI) are engaging in the same tasks as both sides prepare for the inevitable clash. So the basic gameplay is running a few groups around, fighting things, grabbing resources, upgrading your capital city, and then attempting to meet the victory conditions. This is all very much like Heroes Of Might and Magic. But let's talk about how Disciples veers off on a very satisfying different course.	http://www.ign.com/games/halo-wars-2/pc-20041132,http://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-remastered/pc-20066763,http://www.ign.com/games/rome-total-war-2/pc-136961,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505	Strategy	PC	8.5	Great	8.2	Great	GT Interactive	Strategy First	E for Everyone	Blood, Animated Violence	Oct 4, 1999	29.99 USD	http://pc.ign.com/articles/162/162718p1.html

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear	http://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-counter-terrorism-classics-pack/pc-11641	Rogue Spear is a shooter of a different cut. One without health packs and super-futuristic weapons. Death is as close as one shot away -- and since you're usually taking on a superior number of forces, the game stresses solid strategy and planning instead of running in with guns blazing. While your anti-terrorist organization will see action on three continents, most of Rogue Spear takes place in parts of Russia and the former Soviet states. Those familiar with Rainbow Six will be able to jump right into Rogue Spear without having to even crack open the manual. The controls are basically the same as in the original, with a few keys remapped to give it the playability of a more standard shooter. Like Rainbow Six, when you start a mission, you can either opt to go with the pre-determined routes, weapon loadouts, and squad assignments or choose your own. You can customize all of your team members and their paths if you want.	http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-5/pc-20023125,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-7/pc-20054862,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505	Action	PC DC GBA PS PS Mac	9.2	Amazing	8.6	Great	Red Storm Entertainment	Red Storm Entertainment	T for Teen	Blood, Gore, Animated Violence	Sep 22, 1999	64.99 USD	http://pc.ign.com/articles/161/161641p1.html

In 2000, EA tries to add to the already in-depth game, and keeping the same features that made it the best before. It seems they have done it again. EA has introduced its career-mode, letting you play up to 10 seasons, trade, draft, watch your players grow old and nimble and retire. Sign some young studs and watch them grow into tomorrow?s superstars. Exhibition, Season, Career, Playoffs and even a skills challenge to tone your skills. NHL 2000 has everything you would possibly desire from a hockey game.	http://www.ign.com/games/ncaa-football-2001/ps-14657,http://www.ign.com/games/nhl-2001/ps-14658,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/ps-14304,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Sports	PS PC GBC	9.1	Amazing	8.4	Great	Electronic Arts	EA Canada	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	September 1999	38.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161605p1.html
Driver	http://www.ign.com/games/driver/pc-3933	You play an undercover cop named Tanner who is hired as a driver for the mob. Of course, the cops don?t know that you are a cop, so when things go awry, they?ll hunt you down as if you were gutter trash. Should your driving skills be good enough to outwit the law (unfortunately for you, these guys are smarter than your average Roscoe P. Coltrane), you?ll move up in the mob world. Driver lets gamers relive the old Starsky & Hutch-style police chases, and then use the replay mode to create their own mini-chase scene movies. Just make sure the hero gets away -- the movies where the law wins are never any fun.	http://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-3/pc-20054784,http://www.ign.com/games/flatout-4/pc-20068143,http://www.ign.com/games/ubisoft-the-crew/pc-20000080,http://www.ign.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen/pc-131477,http://www.ign.com/games/ubisoft-the-crew/pc-20000080,http://www.ign.com/games/guacamelee/pc-20003228,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505	Racing	PC PS PS Mac PSP GBC iPhone PS3	8.9	Great	7.9	Good	GT Interactive	Reflections Interactive	T for Teen	Mild Language	Oct 11, 1999	9.99 USD	http://pc.ign.com/articles/153/153933p1.html

Virtua Fighter 3tb	http://www.ign.com/games/virtua-fighter-3/dc-9976	Virtua Fighter 3 was years ahead of its time and still the best looking arcade fighter available. Yu Suzuki has said he is determined to make the series look and play just like real fighting by the fifth installment, and the third game brought him amazingly close to his goal. A cast of twelve fighters, each sporting a unique real fighting art, battles in environments which reflect real world locations. Gone are the floating arenas seen in most other 3-D fighters -- instead, we can intricately detailed environments which go well beyond the flat plane, introducing gradual vertical shifts which may give an opponent the advantage in battle. For the first time ever, positioning really makes a difference in the fight.New to the series is the evade button, though the setup remains as simple as ever. Don't underestimate the simple control scheme though, since Virtua Fighter 3: Team Battle is easily the deepest fighter around. You simply cannot button mash your way through the ranks -- VF3:TB is all about skill. While the complex battle system may turn off some, there's no denying the game's place as one of if not the best fighting game around. Genki's port of AM2's arcade game, while less than perfect, still manages to bring all of the strategy and fun home along with most of the visual wonder.	http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967,http://www.ign.com/games/soulcalibur/dc-10953,http://www.ign.com/games/ultimate-fighting-championship/dc-14160,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967	Fighting	DC Saturn Arcade	8.7	Great	7.9	Good	SEGA	SEGA-AM2, Genki	T for Teen	Animated Violence	October 19, 1999	35.99 USD	http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/159/159976p1.html

Resident Evil 3: Nemesis	http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482	With the gruesome T-Virus finally dormant, Jill Valentine has resigned from S.T.A.R.S. and is going to leave what's left of Raccoon City. Much to her dismay, her exit has been delayed by the same flesh-eating zombies that plagued her counterparts in the first two games! This time, however, the undead are augmented by bloodthirsty hunters, evil hellhounds, and other terrors of the night. As Jill, you'll meet up with a lot of new faces, and some old ones too. Carlos Olivera, for example, is an Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service Agent that seems to want to help you out; whether you trust him or not is up to you. Each time you meet up with an enemy, you can either confront it or evade it, but your choices all add up in this immersing tale of terror. Of course, you do have some pretty powerful ammo to back you up, and the game even lets you combine weapons to make your own firepower. The third installment in the popular RESIDENT EVIL series, this one boasts improved graphics, sound, and overall gameplay. Hidden at the end of the adventure is a bonus Mercenaries game   but you'll be lucky if you live to see it.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/ps-336,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/ps-336,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Third-Person, Action	PS DC GCN PS3 PSP PC	9.4	Amazing	8.9	Great	Capcom	Capcom	M for Mature	Blood and Gore, Violence	November 11, 1999	49.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161482p1.html

The Multiplayer mode lets two people race head-to-head in their own customized vehicles in a split-screen battle.

Each of the 99 levels starts with a unique arrangement of pipes and slotted gears. Balls of various colors roll through a pipe at the top of the screen, and they'll fall into the gear and pipe arrangement. The goal is to get balls of the same color to fill all of the slots of a gear. Once that happens, the balls disappear. But time is always a factor in doing this, so you've got to be efficient. As the game progresses, several complicating factors enter the mix: some pipes will only allow balls to travel one way, and other will only let balls of one color pass through. The biggest problem is that some levels require colors be removed in a particular order.

Rocket: Robot on Wheels	http://www.ign.com/games/rocket-robot-on-wheels/n64-11736	"First-time Nintendo 64 developer Sucker Punch Studios jumped onto the scene with a highly original 3D platformer. The design philosophy behind the title is simple -- rather than build the platformer around the main character, the software house opted instead to focus on the interactivity of the 3D environments he travels. To that end, Rocket employs an advanced physics engine which allows the main character, a lovable unicycle-based robot named Rocket, to travel and experiment with colorful, platform-esque worlds with realistic gravity and inertia. Every object has its own set of lifelike attributes that must be ""weighed"" into consideration when solving puzzles."	http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-64/n64-606,http://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-64/n64-607,http://www.ign.com/games/banjo-kazooie/n64-1922,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Platformer	N64	9.0	Amazing	8.6	Great	Ubisoft	Sucker Punch	E for Everyone	null	November 17, 1999	59.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/161/161736p1.html

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six	http://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six/n64-10587	Combining the best elements of action and strategy games, RAINBOW SIX is as tense as they come. Choose your character directly from the Tom Clancy thriller that inspired the game, then put your thinking cap on, because you're going to have to plan out this entire mission on your own. Venture into the dens of terrorists, diffuse bombs, and free hostages, as top-notch military strategy is of utmost importance. Details are the name of the game here you start with a map of the level, set your waypoints and operative strategies, select gear, and more. Once you've set all of these things up, your team will actually execute the orders you've registered whether you're with them or not; if you're storming into a building, your fellow Rainbows might be picking off snipers or setting a bomb. The graphics are smooth and consistent, the music is intense, and with 12 missions, the game lasts a long, long time. In the tradition of GOLDENEYE, the action takes place from a first-person perspective, and you can choose a Quick-Start option that skips over the strategizing and lets you get right into the fray. There's even a Two-Player mode that puts you and your friend on the same team!	http://www.ign.com/games/goldeneye/n64-1991,http://www.ign.com/games/doom/n64-503,http://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark/n64-3906,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	First-Person, Shooter	N64 PC PS DC Mac PS3 PSP GBC PC	8.5	Great	8.0	Great	Red Storm Entertainment	Saffire	T for Teen	Blood, Gore, Animated Violence	November 17, 1999	38.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/160/160587p1.html

Medal of Honor [1999]	http://www.ign.com/games/medal-of-honor-1999/ps-11925	MEDAL OF HONOR is set in the middle of World War II. As a member of the Office of Strategic Services department, you're called upon to do your duty and help the Allies win the war. You'll have to infiltrate enemy bases, sabotage equipment, steal documents, and generally foil the Nazi's plans. Being an OSS agent doesn't only require you to be handy with a gun, as there will be times when you must go undercover, using forged papers and stolen Nazi uniforms to gain access to areas that are otherwise inaccessible. To accomplish these task gamers get to use 12 authentic period weapons including the Tommy gun, potato masher grenades, and the powerful bazooka. However, since you are often sneaking around and utilizing your stealth abilities, MEDAL OF HONOR tends to feel more like an adventure game, rather then a straight ahead first-person shooter. The game has 30 3D levels and incredibly intelligent enemy AI, resulting in MEDAL OF HONOR being one of the best first-person shooters to ever appear on a console.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS PSP PS3	9.3	Amazing	8.8	Great	Electronic Arts	DreamWorks Interactive	T for Teen	Animated Violence	November 11, 1999	28.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161925p1.html

There are dozens of hilarious mini-games to play, such as ""Spank the Monkey with Mr. Mackey,"" ""Asses in Space with Terrence and Philip,"" ""Tethered Pheasant Shoot with Jimbo and Ned,"" and lots more. With animation and graphics that are very much akin to the television show, the game is perfect for SOUTH PARK fans, trivia buffs, or anyone who appreciates an offbeat, slightly off-color gaming experience.

Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko	http://www.ign.com/games/gex-3-deep-cover-gecko/n64-10575	Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko for the Nintendo 64 is a 3D game that features the popular secret agent Gex in even more outrageous situations. This time, Gex must save his fellow agent X-Tra from his nemesis Rez. To accomplish this, he must collect remote controls from each world, thereby opening up new levels. The game contains many features that help separate it from most other platformers, though. One is the appearance of comedian Dana Gould as the voice of Gex. Throughout the game, he spouts humorous one-liners, adding to the feeling of interactivity. Also, each level follows a different television related theme that many gamers will instantly recognize. Gex can also gain numerous abilities that are based on these levels, making each one play differently from the last. Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko takes the familiar platform game formula and adds enough unique twists to make it distinctively different from every other game on the market.	http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-64/n64-606,http://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-64/n64-607,http://www.ign.com/games/banjo-kazooie/n64-1922,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Platformer	N64 GBC PSP PS3 PS	5.8	Mediocre	6.6	Okay	Crave Entertainment	Crystal Dynamics	E for Everyone	Comic Mischief, Mild Animated Violence	September 29, 1999	28.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/160/160575p1.html

Once you build enough credibility, you can start to answer a gang's pages and go on missions, which range from narcotics deliveries to assassinations.

There are dozens of hilarious mini-games to play, such as ""Spank the Monkey with Mr. Mackey,"" ""Asses in Space with Terrence and Philip,"" ""Tethered Pheasant Shoot with Jimbo and Ned,"" and lots more. With animation and graphics that are very similar to the television show, the game is perfect for SOUTH PARK fans, trivia buffs, or anyone who appreciates an offbeat, slightly off-color gaming experience. The voices of Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Isaac Hayes make the game sound and feel very much like the Comedy Central classic cartoon, and the variety of old-fashioned mini-games will have appreciators of old Atari games and coin-ops thrilled."	http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Trivia	N64 PS DC PC	5.3	Mediocre	6.0	Okay	Acclaim Entertainment	Acclaim Studios Austin	M for Mature	Comic Mischief, Mature Sexual Themes	December 10, 1999	59.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/161/161792p1.html

The game takes place eight years before the arrival of Reinhardt Schneider and Carrie Fernandez. Cornell, a seemingly simple and quiet man, is a bit distant to his neighbors. But there's a reason for his seemingly unsocial behavior: he is a man-wolf, who through meditation and use of his intelligence has managed to keep his internal beast at bay. One day Cornell returns home to his village to find his sister has been kidnapped by demons that have nefarious plans for her. Cornell snaps and reverts to his feral self, and that's when you take over. By defeating enemies with your werewolf attack, you'll be able to pick up jewels left behind that can be used to transform into a wolf or to serve as ammo for your weapons: holy water, crosses, axes, and knives.	http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Action	N64	6.8	Okay	7.7	Good	Konami	Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe (KCEK)	T for Teen	Blood, Animated Violence	December 6, 1999	59.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/161/161971p1.html

The game still takes place over multiple planets in the Star Wars universe -- the deserts of Tatooine, the ice tracks of Ando Prime, and swamps of Baroonda. You take control of Anakin and try and defeat your ""rival"" on each of the game's tracks. When you come in first on any track, you can take control of that track's ""rival"" alien and his pod racer -- and each alien's Pod Racer controls and drives differently. The controls are of the simple Accelerate, Brake, Left Turn, Right Turn nature -- but like the N64 version of the game, you can activate an Engine Boost when your speed reaches a certain peak. But it's only for temporary use, and will cause damage to your engines if you leave it on for longer than a few seconds."	http://www.ign.com/games/hot-wheels-stunt-track-driver/gbc-13350,http://www.ign.com/games/test-drive-cycles/gbc-12230,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-ii/gbc-15416,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version/gbc-16709,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version/gbc-12865,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-crystal-version/gbc-15402	Racing	GBC Mac DC PS PC N64	6.0	Okay	6.9	Okay	Nintendo	LucasArts	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	December 6, 1999	34.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162211p1.html

This time, the game is a rail shooter along the same lines as Panzer Dragoon. The graphics have been improved, with a more detailed Godzilla model matching the newer monster suit nearly perfectly. On top of the new Godzilla and monster graphics, everything movies exactly how you'd expect having watched the movies. Godzilla has a slightly longer stride than the original suit, but everything else brings back fond memories of Godzilla vs. (insert monster name here). The flying monsters, such as Mothra, move as if they were hanging by wires, and the little helicopters, jets, and tanks look like small toys. The monster sounds for Godzilla and the various monsters are dead-on. When Godzilla roars, you instantly recognize the sound from the classic films.	http://www.ign.com/games/shenmue/dc-14499,http://www.ign.com/games/shenmue-ii/dc-15624,http://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-2000/dc-15779,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967	Action	DC	2.5	Painful	6.4	Okay	SEGA	General Entertainment	null	null	Japan Only	null	http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/163/163276p1.html

Arcade has you pick a team and try to defeat all of the other teams in the league, while in the Season mode, you take your team through the grueling NFL season in hopes of making the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl.

The plot is simple: It's the 1970s, and you can play as either a good driver trying to get money from the bad guys, or you can play as a bad guy and try to steal money from wherever you can. There are also elements of time travel, which allow cars and weaponry from the future to show up. The premise is the same as the original, as you drive around in a 3D environment and complete mission objectives, all the while avoiding the enemy. Once you meet all your mission objectives you can move on to the next stage. There are numerous cars and levels to choose from, secret characters to find, and some two-player multiplayer options to help the replay value. For fans of the original VIGILANTE 8, this is a sure bet.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS GBA N64 DC	8.2	Great	8.6	Great	Activision	Luxoflux Corp.

South Park: Chef's Luv Shack	http://www.ign.com/games/south-park-chefs-luv-shack/pc-13575	"Trivia is the order of the day, as Chef plays host to the most twisted game show you could ever imagine. Playing as Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, or Stan, you have to put your thinking cap on in order to call on more useless knowledge than your competition. With trivia categories like ""Giant Japanese Monster Bad,"" and ""Sucks or Canadian,"" the answers are often subjective, and rarely about SOUTH PARK itself. There are dozens of hilarious mini-games to play, such as ""Spank the Monkey with Mr. Mackey,"" ""Asses in Space with Terrence and Philip,"" ""Tethered Pheasant Shoot with Jimbo and Ned,"" and lots more. With animation and graphics that are very much akin to the television show, the game is perfect for SOUTH PARK fans, trivia buffs, or anyone who appreciates an offbeat, slightly off-color gaming experience. The voices of Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Isaac Hayes make the game sound and feel very much like the Comedy Central classic cartoon, and the variety of old-fashioned mini-games will have appreciators of old Atari games and coin-ops thrilled."	http://www.ign.com/games/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-2nd-edition-uk/pc-832835,http://www.ign.com/games/you-dont-know-jack/pc-100236,http://www.ign.com/games/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-1999/pc-13563,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505	Trivia	PC N64 PS DC	5.5	Mediocre	7.2	Good	Acclaim Entertainment	Acclaim Studios Austin	M for Mature	Comic Mischief, Mature Sexual Themes	Dec 5, 1999	9.99 USD	http://pc.ign.com/articles/163/163575p1.html

If you mistreat your cat, your little pet will take off, never to return! Eventually, new breeds of cats and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do.

Q*bert	http://www.ign.com/games/qbert-886070/ps-11432	The much-loved orange hero returns to the spotlight in this faithful update on the coin-operated classic. In the PlayStation version, you'll find the original game, a new Adventure mode, and a fun two-player Head-to-Head version of the arcade game. As you might recall, the original Q*BERT challenges you to hop the little guy around a pyramid of cubes, changing their colors as he lands on them. The object is to transform the colors of each cube in order to advance to the next pyramid. Of course, it won't be easy, as you avoid enemies (like our hero's nemesis, Coily the snake), pick up special items, and try not to fall off. Other enemies will change the cubes' colors back, making your job even harder. In the new Adventure mode, Coily has kidnapped some of Q*bert's friends, and the orange fellow will have to hop on some cubes to free them. Unlike the original, there are differently shaped boards, secret levels, transports, and special cubes to spice things up. The Head-to-Head game is much like the arcade original, with two players trying to change the cubes to their own colors and attempting to snag as many bonus cubes as possible along the way. It's nothing but fun, as a classic makes its triumphant return.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS PC DC Mac	6.9	Okay	6.8	Okay	Hasbro Interactive	Artech Studios	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	December 1999	14.97 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161432p1.html

Never fear though, because scattered throughout the levels are more berries of the throwing variety and the health-giving variety. Just when things look their darkest, Flik can count on his insect friends to make the save!!!

While many of the levels offer platform-jumping, vine-swinging fun, some of them recreate some of the action sequences from the movie. No matter where he is, Tarzan must collect the tokens and fruit that are scattered about. Collecting 100 tokens earns an extra life, and the fruit can be used to dispose of enemies. If you can collect the four pieces of Jane's baboon drawing, you can earn the chance to play a bonus level. You've got to help the young ape-man discover his place in the world with Tarzan.	http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Action	N64 GBC PSP PS3 PS PS	7.8	Good	7.0	Good	Activision	Eurocom	E for Everyone	Violence	February 14, 2000	57.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/161/161226p1.html
Railroad Tycoon II	http://www.ign.com/games/railroad-tycoon-2-platinum-edition/ps-11104	So, you fancy yourself a businessman, eh? See how you stack up against the real fat cats as you try to turn a locomotive and few feet of track into an empire. The game spans from 1804 to beyond the year 2020, setting you off on 18 campaigns of varying difficulty. There are over 60 different engine types and 34 cargo-train types at your disposal, but how you use them will determine just how powerful you are. The game begins with a tutorial and then jumps right into the first campaign. You'll first need to decide which type of track and bridges you want to use, trying to make the most of your money without building a faulty line. Once you begin to purchase trains and plan their routes, you'll see why many a man went broke in this business: finding open areas with sizable enough populations is no simple task. As the game progresses you'll actually be able to sell stock in your company, and if you play your cards right you might just get filthy rich.	http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics/ps-26,http://www.ign.com/games/age-of-empires/ps-20051961,http://www.ign.com/games/command-and-conquer-red-alert/ps-2198,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Strategy	PS PC Mac	6.0	Okay	6.7	Okay	Take-Two Interactive	Gear Head Studios	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	February 2000	13.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161104p1.html

Years ago, your father disappeared while exploring the treasure-laden Monster Tower, a massive structure filled with a variety of dangers. Now, you are finally old enough to go to the Tower and find out what really happened to your father. Since many explorers have surely charted out the Tower beforehand, finding what you are looking for should be a snap, right? Not quite, because the Monster Tower changes its entire layout every time you visit, providing new challenges and areas to explore every time you enter. What doesn't change, however, is the number of monsters lurking around looking to end your quest. To help fight them, you can enlist some monsters of your own. Combined with the tons of treasure you'll find, you'll be well equipped to tackle the dangers of the Tower.	http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version/gbc-16709,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version/gbc-12865,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-crystal-version/gbc-15402,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version/gbc-16709,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version/gbc-12865,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-crystal-version/gbc-15402	RPG	GBC PS NDS	6.0	Okay	7.2	Good	Konami	Konami	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	February 2000	35.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162214p1.html

Top Gear Hyperbike	http://www.ign.com/games/top-gear-hyperbike/n64-11443	Motorbike racer set in the Top Gear series. The Championship mode has you alternating between dirt and street racing as you compete for points. You earn new bikes and courses along the way like many other games, but interesting twist is going from one kind of racing to the other. The physics of each type of racing are very different, and you'll have to switch back and forth between dirt and racing tactics on the fly. The dirt bike racing is a lot more arcadey with all of the jumps and wide open tracks. You can earn turbo by pulling off tricks and there's really nothing to stop you from testing your stunt skills while racing except your own nerve and imagination. In this way, Hyperbike is like Hydro Thunder where you're expected to lean on that turbo button the whole time and it's up to your racing skills to ensure there's turbo available.	http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/diddy-kong-racing/n64-2146,http://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-x/n64-418,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Racing	N64	6.1	Okay	6.5	Okay	Kemco	Snowblind Studios	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	March 27, 2000	59.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/161/161443p1.html

SEGA Swirl	http://www.ign.com/games/sega-swirl/dc-13481	If you're looking for an alternative to SOLITAIRE on your PC, then SEGA SWIRL is the game for you. The object of the game is simple: clear the board of all the different colored swirls (which look eerily like the Dreamcast logo). As you remove a swirl or group of swirls, the remaining swirls fall down to fill the gap left by the removed swirls. In essence, SEGA SWIRL can be thought of as an inverse TETRIS. You get more points for removing chains of swirls, so strategy is an important element of the gameplay. As you progress, chains will become less frequent and planning and forethought become the real challenge. There are several different game modes available, like playing against the computer, against up to three friends, or just against the clock. You can also play through e-mail, which slows the gameplay down considerably but gives you many more possible opponents.	http://www.ign.com/games/super-puzzle-fighter-ii-x-for-matching-service/dc-492483,http://www.ign.com/games/chu-chu-rocket/dc-14096,http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-move-4/dc-14152,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967	Puzzle	DC Palm PC	8.2	Great	7.5	Good	SEGA	Tremor Entertainment	E for Everyone	null	January 12, 2000	null	http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/163/163481p1.html

One to four players compete against each other or the computer in a no-holds-barred battle with customizable rules.

The first thing you need to decide when you sit down to play this smash sequel to Street Sk8er is, do you jump on your board and tackle the 11 teeth-rattling events that come ready to play in the game, including street, halfpipe, and park courses or do you take over an abandoned warehouse and design your ultimate skate park?

Levels include multiple paths and shortcuts, as well as windows, barrels, and other breakable objects because it wouldn't be skating unless SOMETHING got broken. You can also call a friend over and challenge him to a multiplayer Pool Duel, which offers a split-screen mode so you don't miss a bit of the action.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater	http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater/n64-12180	Ported by Edge of Reality, N64 owners received arguably the best version of the breakthrough skateboarding game.

No jumpy, pixelated skaters this time around. The N64 game features smooth, crisp riders rolling and sliding around sharp environments with only the occasional dip in framerate. The c-buttons are a bit tougher on the fingers when you try some higher level tricks and combos, but that's all part of a days job for a hardcore gamer.	http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/n64-14169,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf/n64-10628,http://www.ign.com/games/international-superstar-soccer-2000/n64-15240,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Extreme Sports, Sports	N64 PS GBC DC NNG	9.1	Amazing	8.8	Great	Activision	Neversoft Entertainment, Edge of Reality	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	March 13, 2000	60.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/162/162180p1.html

Replace the two-wheeled carriage with a futuristic, hovering pod -- now take away the horses and strap two giant afterburner-powered engines to the vehicle. The boost of the two fuselages pulls the carriage forward at speeds in excess of 600mph and a stream of pure energy, called a mag beam or coupler, makes sure that the engines don't fly off in opposite directions. Like its ""real,"" up to 40-foot-long counterparts in the movie, Racer's pods use a three-point dynamics system that will cause the carriage to realistically drift in the air behind its two engines.

You find yourself on a dangerous quest to unite with other unlikely heroes, right all that is wrong, and return to your own land once again. There's plenty of hack and slash, role-playing combat, and exploration to be had and with randomized dungeons there's always new territory to fight and forage through. Just be careful, because you can only carry four valuable items at a time as you delve into the dank and foreboding underground lairs. Sword's war party grows as he journeys with the addition of stout allies and cash rewards are given if enough vicious monsters are slain. Not sure just how a creature is feeling towards you?

Bomberman Max -- Red: Challenger	http://www.ign.com/games/bomberman-max-red-challenger/gbc-13138	In Bomberman Max, your task is to jump through five zones with a dozen levels each. At the beginning of the round, you're given your quota to meet -- in some levels, you'll have to destroy all the enemies. In another, wipe out all the blocks in the land. In another, rescue the level's Charabomb. And in others, simply make your way to the target square in the set amount of time. But it won't be easy, since many enemies just don't stay still for you to walk up and plant a bomb next to them. It's all in the strategy of bomb-placement. Plus, once a level's complete, you'll have to pick the proper exit that appears.

Dinosaur	http://www.ign.com/games/dinosaur/gbc-14326	Travel back to prehistoric times, with Disney's DINOSAUR for the Game Boy Color. Loosely based on the computer-animated feature film, players will have to guide Aladar the Iguanadon, Zini the Lemur, and Flia the Pteranodon through 12 different levels, using each of their unique abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Aladar's strength and brute force are great assets, but there are times when the smaller, quicker Zini will need to take over. Neither of them will do you any good if a situation calls for the ability to fly, though so it's a good thing Flia is with you on this adventure. Learning to use each of these characters to overcome obstacles is the key to avoiding extinction! With video taken directly from the film and an encyclopedia covering all the creatures in the game, Disney's DINOSAUR will immerse players in a world that existed millions of years ago.	http://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-yoda-stories/gbc-12088,http://www.ign.com/games/hamtaro-ham-hams-unite/gbc-493740,http://www.ign.com/games/dino-crisis/gbc-13974,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version/gbc-16709,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version/gbc-12865,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-crystal-version/gbc-15402	Adventure	GBC PS2 PS PC DC	4.0	Bad	4.4	Bad	Ubisoft	Digital Eclipse Software	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	May 20, 2000	38.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/164/164326p1.html

Wild ARMs 2	http://www.ign.com/games/wild-arms-2/ps-12916	Finally, a sequel has come for one of the PlayStation's first RPGs with WILD ARMS: 2nd Ignition. The game features a new story and cast of characters, this time led by a mysterious person named Ashley. The story spans various locations and dungeons around the world, offering varying graphical and musical styling. The visuals remain as the same type as the first game: there is a ¿ perspective view that looks down on the characters, something unique from just about every other RPG available. The backgrounds appear as 3D polygons, though each of the characters are sprites, with plenty of animations to make their motions fluid and smooth. The battle system is a slow-paced turn-based affair, letting the player have plenty of time to think over each move. WILD ARMS: 2nd Ignition offers gameplay that mixes the classic RPG style with other contemporary games, and a graphics system that no other game can match.	http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Turn-Based, RPG	PS PS3 PSP	6.0	Okay	7.9	Good	Sony Computer Entertainment	Media.Vision	E for Everyone	Violence	April 30, 2000	9.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/162/162916p1.html

You can choose from 130 different European club teams thanks to the UEFA license. After you choose a team, work on strategies, tactics, and learn the controls with the Training mode. When you are ready for some competition, there are eight other gameplay modes to choose from. No matter the mode, the artificial intelligence of the computer-controlled players creates the most realistic simulation possible. In other words, defenders mark their men extremely well and make things as challenging as you'd expect from world-class competition. If you can get past the defense, you must contend with goalies that are virtually brick walls. The offensive players are no slouches either; they instinctively push forward to capitalize on breakaway opportunities. STRIKER PRO 2000 puts you in the middle of a soccer match without having to put on your cleats.	http://www.ign.com/games/ncaa-football-2001/ps-14657,http://www.ign.com/games/nhl-2001/ps-14658,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/ps-14304,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Sports	PS DC	7.2	Good	7.8	Good	Infogrames	Rage Software	E for Everyone	null	April 2000	17.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/163/163527p1.html
Perfect Dark	http://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark/n64-3906	Spiritual sequel to GoldenEye. Starring special agent Joanna DarkT, the storyline, is brought to life by outstanding cinemas and surprisingly good voice-acting. Shooting, with some snazzy new weapons, is still the primary focus of the game, but with all of the tasks and puzzles to get through, you'll have to use your brain as well as your trigger finger to get by. It is in this way, that Perfect Dark, pays the ultimate respect to GoldenEye. Rare took so many steps to differentiate this game from its three year old predecessor, but the one thing that is consistent over both games, is the extraordinary depth and rich gameplay. If you didn't play GE, you might have a hell of a time learning how a game like PD thinks and what kind of behavior is rewarded.	http://www.ign.com/games/goldeneye/n64-1991,http://www.ign.com/games/doom/n64-503,http://www.ign.com/games/jet-force-gemini/n64-3862,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	First-Person, Shooter	N64 GBC Xbox 360	9.8	Amazing	9.3	Amazing	Nintendo	Rare	M for Mature	Blood, Animated Violence	May 22, 2000	49.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153906p1.html

Also augmented is the Home Run Challenge, which now lets you choose whether you want to take your pitches overhand, side-armed, or submarined.

Monster Rancher Battle Card GB	http://www.ign.com/games/monster-rancher-battle-card-gb/gbc-13336	Your goal in life is to become the world's greatest monster breeder. In order to do this, you must travel around the world, challenging other breeders to card matches. If you win, you will collect more cards. If you can pass all of the license matches and collect all 100 cards, you will join the ranks of the master breeders.

Roadsters	http://www.ign.com/games/roadsters/ps-11757	Which do you like more: racing or gambling? There's no need to decide in this intense 3D racing game that puts an emphasis on betting. You begin the game with $50,000, but you're going to have to spend a chunk of that on a car. Choose from over 30 vehicles (only from within your price range, of course), then use whatever cash you can scrounge together to make modifications. You can win cash by placing high enough in races, but the real dough lies in betting on yourself. Each race lets you put up however much of your hard-earned green as you'd like, and if you win the bet you double that amount. Don't like to gamble? Tough luck. There's no way to stay competitive without the right parts, and no way to get those parts without income from wagering. In order to win the Roadsters Trophy, you'll need to rise through three divisions on your way to glory. If you're looking for a quick fix, there's a Quick Race mode that lets you get in and race the computer in a one-time event on any of the game's 10 tracks. Time Trial lets you race against your own best time, while Multiplayer lets you battle a friend for bragging rights. Think you've got what it takes to win the cup? Then put your money where your mouth is in ROADSTERS.	http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-1998/ps-2226,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-2/ps-11426,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Racing	PS N64 DC PS2 GBC	3.0	Awful	6.0	Okay	Titus	Titus	E for Everyone	null	April 2000	45.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161757p1.html

Metal Slug: 2nd Mission	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-slug-2nd-mission/ngpc-13051	The second portable installment in the Metal Slug series hasn't strayed at all from the original formula: it's still a guns-blazing weaponfest where you control a lone soldier out to blow up stuff and rescue prisoners. Your soldier has the ability to run, jump, crouch, and fire weapons, and you'll need to use these skills to get through each of the game's 38 missions. The whole idea is to blast your way through the rounds, taking out the enemy soldiers and picking up power-ups. Weapons include a heavy machine gun, a shotgun, missiles, grenades, and a whole bunch more. The other task is to find all the POW soldiers lost in each of the levels -- when you free a prisoner, he'll leave you a weapon power-up after disappearing offering a hearty salute. But you're not only on your feet. Some missions allow you to jump behind the controls of a kick-ass jet plane, tank, and submarine.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-slug-first-mission/ngpc-11050,http://www.ign.com/games/magician-lord/ngpc-13049,http://www.ign.com/games/cotton/ngpc-14165,http://www.ign.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-pocket-adventure/ngpc-12670,http://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1/ngpc-11051,http://www.ign.com/games/samurai-shodown-2-pocket-fighting-series/ngpc-12019	Action	NGPC	9.0	Amazing	9.1	Amazing	SNK [1978-2001]	SNK [1978-2001]	E for Everyone	null	April 25, 2000	null	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/163/163051p1.html

The goal, once again, is to destroy as many buildings, streets, and natural environments as you can. This installment of the long-running RAMPAGE series brings back the six monsters that reared their heads in RAMPAGE 2: Universal Tour, and adds two new beasts to the mix: Myukus (a one-eyed purple people-eater) and Harley (a ticked-off warthog). Each character has his own special moves to help him stomp, punch, and destroy every landscape that's unfortunate enough to meet his acquaintance. RAMPAGE THROUGH TIME brings a time-travel element to the mix, with levels set in the Old West, Medieval Times, WWII, and more. The game's 20 stages each have two additional sub-levels, making for an amazing 60 boards in all. There are accompanying mini-games for each environment, creating an unbelievably high fun factor. You can play in three different modes: Adventure (in which you take a random tour of the game's stages) Challenge, and Tournament. There are fantastic multiplayer modes as well, allowing for up to three players via the Multi-tap. If you're looking for a fun, original romp through the ages you need look no further than RAMPAGE THROUGH TIME.	http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Action	PS	3.5	Awful	6.0	Okay	Midway  Games	Midway  Games	T for Teen	Comic Mischief	June 14, 2000	22.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/164/164430p1.html

Rent A Hero No. 1	http://www.ign.com/games/rent-a-hero-no-1/dc-12989	Players star in the role of a hero for hire. Towns will contract the main character to help stop a robbery, rescue people from a crazy robot, or find a lost little girl. Much of the gameplay is spent talking to the more than 60 different characters to gather clues and solve cases. Then there are the fighting levels, where players master 16 different special moves and seven combos. But there is also the less glamorous side of our hero: working part-time to make ends meet and be able to afford his combat suit. This includes pizza delivery, grocery delivery and even putting on a Hero Show.	http://www.ign.com/games/shenmue/dc-14499,http://www.ign.com/games/shenmue-ii/dc-15624,http://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-2000/dc-15779,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/dc-15478,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-code-veronica/dc-10948,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/dc-13388,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967	Third-Person, Action	DC Xbox	8.4	Great	6.5	Okay	SEGA	SEGA	null	null	Import only	null	http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/162/162989p1.html

Released at a lower price than most games of its ilk, GRUDGE WARRIORS certainly doesn't make any sacrifices that would indicate its cost.

Crowley (the sinister adversary from the original NIGHTMARE CREATURES) is up to his old tricks again, unleashing more evil monsters on the citizens of London.

The basic gameplay remains unchanged since the original SimCity. Using simple on-screen menus, players reshape the landscape, set up residential, business and industrial zones, build transportation grids, electric supply, schools and other public institutions and watch their city grow.

Build a transportation network and you'll be able to ride around in a train, a bus or even fly through town in a helicopter.

Players star in the role of a yellow giant who, like the sun, ascends every morning from the sea to visit the peaceful inhabitants of a chain of tropical islands -- and much like the sun, the giant can bring both life and death. Your basic actions are walking, picking up objects or people, raising the terrain by pulling it up or lowering it by jumping on it. As you explore your surroundings, you encounter different tribes of island natives that go about their daily lives. The ultimate goal of the game is to help the different tribes flourish and get them to construct temples and henges to honor your giant. Each time a tribe builds such a structure, it is added to your monument journal. Released only on 64DD (with an even more obscure add-on disk released later), the game was remade for GameCube.	http://www.ign.com/games/kyojin-no-doshin-kaihou-sensen-chibikko-chikko-daishuugou/64dd-14481,http://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-x-expansion-kit/64dd-5488,http://www.ign.com/games/mother-3-expansion-disk/64dd-1915,http://www.ign.com/games/simcopter-64/64dd-5492	Third-Person, Adventure	64DD	6.5	Okay	7.1	Good	Nintendo	Param	null	null	Japan Only (64DD)	null	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/160/160116p1.html

Spirit of Speed 1937	http://www.ign.com/games/spirit-of-speed-1937/dc-14868	Are you geared up for some old-time, Depression-era roadster racing? If so, then you should check out SPIRIT OF SPEED 1937 for the Sega Dreamcast. Much in the same vein of the classic comedy film THE GREAT RACE, SPIRIT OF SPEED lets you take the wheel of 15 jaunty jalopies like Bugattis, Dusenburgs, Mercedes-Benzes, and Alfa Romeos. You compete against the devilishly challenging computer in 10 scenarios, on tracks in varied locales like Montana, Tripoli, and Monza in Italy. The racing takes place in a variety of modes such as Quick Race (which lets you practice and learn courses), Single Race, Championship (tournament-style contests), and Scenario. Master each car's unique acceleration and handling aspects, and make sure your reflexes are quick enough to swing around hairpin turns and avoid collisions. You can use the Dreamcast's analog stick or plug in a third-party steering wheel, as you race to the sound of tires screeching and motors chugging in the antique racing action from Acclaim.	http://www.ign.com/games/crazy-taxi/dc-12006,http://www.ign.com/games/san-francisco-rush-2049/dc-13634,http://www.ign.com/games/yume-uma-ken-99-internet-142167/dc-13795,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967	Racing	DC PC	2.2	Painful	3.3	Awful	Acclaim Entertainment	Broadsword Interactive	E for Everyone	null	June 29, 2000	28.99 USD	http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/164/164868p1.html

Pokemon Puzzle League	http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-puzzle-challenge/n64-14801	Ash, Pikachu, and other league trainers appear in POKÉMON PUZZLE LEAGUE to either cheer you on or to challenge you to a match. The puzzle format is akin to that of TETRIS, in that you must clear rows of blocks that you arrange into layers. However, the games diverge when it comes to gameplay modes. The Single-Player mode pits you against other Pokémon trainers, where you must fill the other's field by clearing rows of blocks from your own field. The same idea applies to the Two-Player mode. In the Spa Service mode, the object is to clear all the blocks up to a specified point. The Time Zone mode gets the clock ticking as you scramble to clear as many blocks as possible within the given time span, while the Marathon mode tests your endurance. There's also the Puzzle mode, where you must clear a set number of blocks given a specified number of moves. By far, this is the mode presenting the most sophisticated level of challenge. You can play most modes in 3D, where you have a cylindrical field instead of a flat two-dimensional field.	http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-move-2-arcade-edition/n64-3606,http://www.ign.com/games/the-new-tetris/n64-10072,http://www.ign.com/games/sanrio-time-net-world/n64-10104,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Puzzle	N64 GBC Wii 3DS	8.9	Great	8.5	Great	Nintendo	NST, Intelligent Systems	E for Everyone	Suitable for Persons Ages Six and Older	September 25, 2000	59.95 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/164/164801p1.html

What would normally take 100 people a few years to build can now be constructed by one person over the course of a few sleepless weeks. It's not going to be easy, but that's why this title is so amazing: it gives you the tools, but the ideas and execution all come from you. Write, design, and map out every detail from the storyline to the dungeon designs. Organize and construct each town (if you want any towns, that is) choosing item locations, weaponry, and even enemy characteristics. You can even take some extra time and design and animate all of your own characters! Every cutscene, introduction, and game ending that you could ever imagine is possible, and all it takes is your imagination and hard work. There are so many monsters, skill sets, scenarios, and characters to be created you might think about setting aside a sizable chunk of time if you want your game to last more than a few measly minutes. If you've got the time you'll be happy to spend it on this meticulous creation.

Spider-Man [2000]	http://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-2000/ps-11498	Everyone's favorite comic about the web-slinging superhero is now an action-packed, 3D videogame for the PlayStation. As Spidey (AKA Peter Parker), you'll trek through the streets of the Big Apple, taking to rooftops, sewer bottoms, and secret villainous hideouts in order to accomplish your many missions. You'll face such dastardly foes as Scorpio, Venom, and Rhino as you use Spidey's web-spinning ability to create traps of all shapes and sizes to capture your nemeses. The webs will also come in handy when you need to swing around the side of a building, scale a wall, or creep along a ceiling. The simple controls make the learning curve pretty easy, and SPIDER-MAN has a few different modes to keep the replay value and fun factor high. Records and Gallery Modes offer lots of secrets to uncover and challenges to meet (bring your thinking cap to the table for this one), while Kid Mode boils the action down to a more basic format for the wee ones.

There are 12 levels to traverse, from Greece all the way to the top of Mount Olympus. You can play as one of three characters: Hercules, Serena, and Iolaus.

Q*bert	http://www.ign.com/games/qbert-809090/gbc-14135	The arcade hit Q*BERT comes to the Game Boy Color. The player takes control of an orange creature that hops around a course built of blocks.

In another our hero finds himself swimming through an underwater submarine, advancing not only forward and backward, but up and down to as he descends deeper into the sunken structure's belly. Each scenario is not only different in design, but in overall gameplay mechanics too. For example, swimming through a sunken submarine requires a bit of strategy, as Bond will have to find well-hidden air pockets in the ship just so that he can breathe and stay alive.

But don't worry if you've tried your hand at Sega Rally 2 and you couldn't really get into it -- V-Rally is a much more accessible game.

You Don't Know Jack, Mock 2	http://www.ign.com/games/you-dont-know-jack-mock-2/ps-14557	You don't know Jack! If you do, then try YOU DON'T KNOW JACK, MOCK 2 for the PlayStation and see how high you can score. This quiz game offers over 1,000 questions that cover a wide variety of topics. Some will test your knowledge of pop culture, while others will question your science skills. Up to three people can play the game at one time, sometimes resulting in heated competition. This is a great game to play with friends, as the host will often insult those who can't get many questions right or keep pressing the wrong buttons. The show's host is full of one-liners and insults, making the game much more about fun than winning. The graphics are simple, yet they show everything that the game needs to convey in a simple manner. With so many questions in the main game, along with several mini-games, YOU DON'T KNOW JACK, MOCK 2 contains hours of gameplay and entertainment.	http://www.ign.com/games/you-dont-know-jack-2001-811114/ps-10529,http://www.ign.com/games/the-quiz/ps-12801,http://www.ign.com/games/ikkyuu-san-the-quiz-142367/ps-774109,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Trivia	PS	8.2	Great	7.8	Good	Sierra Attractions	Starsphere Interactive	T for Teen	Comic Mischief, Strong Language, Suggestive Themes	November 3, 2000	9.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/164/164557p1.html

Speedball 2100	http://www.ign.com/games/speedball-2100/ps-14272	Football has hits, hockey and basketball have some brawls. Speedball, however, has an assortment of arms and eyes bobbing in buckets of blood. Speedball has only two goals: 1) Put the chromium ball in the net, and 2) Hurt your opponent   badly. Take control of one of 16 futuristic cyber-squads, like Brutal Deluxe and the Raw Messiahs, as you shoot for the World Speedball (WSL) championship. You can take full managerial control of your team and deliver pain from the sidelines, and you can buy and sell players with the push of a button. There's one rule we forgot to mention: your team gets 10 points for every opponent that leaves the field on his back. The 3D graphics are sharp and the AI is smart, so be ready for some intense gameplay. Go at it in Arcade mode, or get yourself in a Tournament.

Time passes as you explore the overworld -- but each minute truly counts in Termina. If you don't save someone on the first day, it may be too late on the next. There are no time-outs in Majora's Mask. After 72 (game time) hours, the world ends because an evil, grinning moon crashes into the planet. There is of course Link's compact time machine: the Ocarina. But Link can only jump backwards to the first day of his adventure, which means pretty much everything he accomplished since then is effectively erased. How do you stop the world from ending when there is no way to explore everything in three days and if all you do becomes meaningless anyway the moment you travel back in time?	http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-snap/n64-2335,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/conkers-bad-fur-day/n64-13960,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-64/n64-606	Third-Person, Action	N64 Wii U Wii	9.9	Amazing	9.4	Amazing	Nintendo	Nintendo EAD	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	October 26, 2000	69.95 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/151/151933p1.html

Spider-Man [2000]	http://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-2000/n64-12700	Everyone's favorite comic about the web-slinging superhero is now an action-packed, 3D videogame for the Nintendo 64. As Spidey (AKA Peter Parker), you'll trek through the streets of the Big Apple, taking to rooftops, sewer bottoms, and secret villainous hideouts in order to accomplish your many missions. You'll face such dastardly foes as Scorpio, Venom, and Rhino as you use Spidey's web-spinning ability to create traps of all shapes and sizes to capture your nemeses. The webs will also come in handy when you need to swing around the side of a building, scale a wall, or creep along a ceiling. The simple controls make the learning curve pretty easy, and SPIDER-MAN has a few different modes to keep the replay value and fun factor high. Records and Gallery modes offer lots of secrets to uncover and challenges to meet (bring your thinking cap to the table for this one), while Kid mode boils the action down to a more basic format for the wee ones. It's a tremendously fun game that's very faithful to its subject matter, but the key to succeeding is having real spider sense.	http://www.ign.com/games/doubutsu-no-mori/n64-15246,http://www.ign.com/games/shadowgate-64-trials-of-the-four-towers/n64-3871,http://www.ign.com/games/dinosaur-planet/n64-14516,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Adventure	N64 Mac PS DC GBC PC	8.5	Great	8.1	Great	Activision	Neversoft Entertainment, Edge of Reality	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	November 21, 2000	60.99 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/162/162700p1.html

An evil overlord by the name of Kage Mishima wants the Daikatana more than anything in life, for he's certain it will bring him everlasting power and life.

Just like before, players have low and high punches, lefts and rights, and they can attack with combinations and flurries. Building up a character from scratch consists of taking part in seven real-life boxing exercises: jumping rope, the heavy bag, the speed bag, the sway bag, rumble pads, lifting weights, and aerobics. These exercises are actually mini-games, which you can't slough off; you've got to do them well to get the benefit of the exercise. In the ring you can land a series of solid punches and build up your RUMBLE power. Once all the letters of RUMBLE are lit, you can punch your opponent out of the ring and practically into the parking lot.	http://www.ign.com/games/ncaa-football-2001/ps-14657,http://www.ign.com/games/nhl-2001/ps-14658,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/ps-14304,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/hot-shots-golf-2/ps-13666,http://www.ign.com/games/one-piece-mansion/ps-488410,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Sports	PS Xbox PS2 DC GBA N64	6.0	Okay	7.1	Good	Midway  Games	Midway  Games, Point of View	T for Teen	Animated Violence, Suggestive Themes	November 10, 2000	14.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/165/165569p1.html

As with the original, there are two modes of competition: Arcade mode is fast, furious, and totally non-committal, while Championship mode requires the patience of training, building up a gym, and earning money with wins. It should be noted, however, that the training has been enhanced to provide many new challenges. READY 2 RUMBLE BOXING: Round 2 is for one or two players, and you can save your stats, gym names, and prizes to a Controller Pak.	http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/n64-14169,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf/n64-10628,http://www.ign.com/games/international-superstar-soccer-2000/n64-15240,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/star-fox-64/n64-419,http://www.ign.com/games/diddy-kong-racing/n64-2146,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Sports	N64 Xbox PS2 PS DC GBA	7.0	Good	7.6	Good	Midway  Games	Midway  Games	T for Teen	Animated Violence, Suggestive Themes	November 15, 2000	14.9 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/164/164950p1.html

Road Rash	http://www.ign.com/games/road-rash-809278/gbc-15149	Jump on a motorcycle and beat up the competition in ROAD RASH. You must race 15 other competitors to the finish line, but there's a catch: your opponents are equipped with weapons including chains, clubs, and pipes, and they have no problems using them on you when you get too close. Luckily, you can kick to get rid of these guys, or you just might be able to catch one and steal his weapon. Keep in mind, though, that the cops are patrolling and will not hesitate to pull you over. By placing in the top three of any race, you will be awarded some cash to spend on new bike parts or a whole new motorcycle. If your friends want to join the brutal action, they can with the Link Cable mode.

Samba de Amigo Ver. 2000	http://www.ign.com/games/samba-de-amigo-ver-2000/dc-15504	This follow-up to SEGA's arcade Dreamcast music game. Version 2000 takes the basics from the original, features twice as many songs, and adds a few new ideas, such as the Hustle maneuver. The normal Samba play requires that you do one of the following: shake your maracas controllers in one of six positions relative to your body (sometimes fast, sometimes slow), or sustain an extended goofball looking pose with the maracas. So what's missing? How about a move that requires you to rapidly sway the Maracas between two of the positions? You'll hustle with one Maraca between the top two positions, and you'll turn to the side and hustle with both maracas between the top left and left-most positions. Originally slated for US release, this update was only made available in Japan.	http://www.ign.com/games/space-channel-5/dc-14181,http://www.ign.com/games/space-channel-5-part-2/dc-488915,http://www.ign.com/games/cool-cool-toon-167929/dc-14240,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967	Music	DC	9.6	Amazing	9.0	Amazing	null	Sonic Team	null	null	null	null	http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/165/165504p1.html

Well, this cool video game for the GBC is the first-ever interactive game that actually lets you play as the beloved Martian rather than fight against him, and the results are hilarious.

The object is to collect all of the necessary items before the other Warner Bros. gang catches you, and evading them won't exactly be a stroll in the park.

Final Fantasy	http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy/wsc-15845	An enhanced port of the classic NES roleplaying game. Inspired by the success of Enix's Dragon Quest game, Square decided to release a similarly styled role-playing game with a different theme for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The title, Final Fantasy, debuted on Japan's Famicom in 1987 to critical and fiscal success. Final Fantasy's storyline, which dealt in mythological archetypes and confusing time loops, was deeper and more engaging than the one that powered the original Dragon Quest. Square's RPG also established left-against-right turn-based battle and magic systems that have been copied by competitors ever since. The game was a phenomenal success and has spawned a series that, initially exclusive to Nintendo consoles, later branched out to Sony's machines and non-interactive formats.In Final Fantasy, the tale begins when four young warriors, each possessing a Crystal, are summoned to bring the world back to a harmonious elemental balance. During their voyage, they discover a nefarious entity has created turmoil in the structure of time in order to take control of the world, causing the heroes to travel to places they never imagined possible.	http://www.ign.com/games/rundim/wsc-835402,http://www.ign.com/games/wild-card/wsc-495916,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-ii/wsc-15846,http://www.ign.com/games/rundim/wsc-835402,http://www.ign.com/games/wild-card/wsc-495916,http://www.ign.com/games/gekitou-crash-gear-turbo/wsc-854004	RPG	WSC Cell WinPhone PSP MSX2 PS3 PS NES Wii	8.6	Great	9.1	Amazing	Square	Square	null	null	null	null	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165845p1.html

The Next Tetris: On-Line Edition	http://www.ign.com/games/the-next-tetris/dc-14852	"The famous falling blocks are back! The world's most popular puzzle game returns with a few new twists in THE NEXT TETRIS: On-Line Edition. The action is relatively simple: on a playing field 10-blocks wide by 20-blocks high, different shaped pieces fall from the top of the screen and float down towards the bottom; your job is to turn each piece as it drops in order to form complete horizontal lines of blocks. As you fill in rows completely, they disappear but if your field fills up with pieces or if the time limit expires, you've lost the game. This concept is elementary, but highly addictive. NEXT TETRIS adds a few changes to the mix as well. ""Multimino"" pieces have been added, which contain different colored blocks within them. When these land the colors separate, and if they don't match the surrounding pieces, they fall down and fill in spaces below. These lines may fill up and disappear, creating a ""Cascade,"" where as many as five or six rows vanish in succession. In addition to single-player Classic and Next Tetris, you can compete against a friend or head online where scores can be compared against worldwide opponents."	http://www.ign.com/games/super-puzzle-fighter-ii-x-for-matching-service/dc-492483,http://www.ign.com/games/chu-chu-rocket/dc-14096,http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-move-4/dc-14152,http://www.ign.com/games/power-stone/dc-10637,http://www.ign.com/games/crazy-taxi/dc-12006,http://www.ign.com/games/ready-2-rumble-boxing/dc-11165,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967	Puzzle	DC PC Nuon PS	8.0	Great	7.4	Good	Crave Entertainment	SEGA	E for Everyone	null	December 20, 2000	49.99 USD	http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/164/164852p1.html

Word bubbles appear on screen, and you (and a partner) must type the word correctly to register a shot at the oncoming zombie army. While bizarre and almost dull sounding, Typing of the Dead is one of the best and unique Dreamcast games on the market.

There are lots of mini-games thrown in to keep things interesting, and to help you hone your skills for the real competition. Play by yourself, or take on a friend in a head-to-head match to find out who's fastest. The computer AI is very high, meaning each one-player race will be a real test of skill and maturity. Do you have what it takes to be the king of the waves?

Later on these pads are used to activate a slingshot and throwing knives; to turn Conker into an anvil and drop downward; to shoot automatic, double-handed guns; to activate a The Matrix-inspired slow-motion effect and flip through the air shooting enemies; and much, much more.	http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933	Action	N64	9.9	Amazing	9.3	Amazing	Rare	Rare	M for Mature	Animated Violence, Mature Sexual Themes, Strong Language	March 05, 2001	69.95 USD	http://ign64.ign.com/articles/163/163960p1.html

Dance Dance Revolution [2001]	http://www.ign.com/games/ddr-festival-dance-dance-revolution/ps-11525	One of the world's most influential games makes its way out of Japan for a home-based dance experience like no other. Using a big dance mat (sold separately), you'll step to the beat of the song playing, executing a specific set of moves to a tee. Your cues will come from the screen in the form of four columns of instructions that scroll upwards. Score points by nailing the timing of each step and getting the order of moves correct. The action will get faster and more furious as the game progresses, instructing you to pull off trickier combos in more limited time periods. As in the Japanese release of the game, a Diet mode shows you how many calories you're burning. To account for the steep learning curve, DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION even includes a Training mode to get you started. Packed with remixes of old songs and brand-new gems, the soundtrack boasts 27 danceable tunes. Though it's possible to play without the dance mat, working up a sweat is half the fun of this inventive game.	http://www.ign.com/games/guitar-freaks/ps-12563,http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-groove-2/ps-11939,http://www.ign.com/games/mtv-music-generator/ps-13748,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Music	PS Arcade Cell PC PC	9.3	Amazing	8.5	Great	Konami	Konami TYO	E for Everyone	Mild Lyrics	March 2001	34.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161525p1.html

In Dr. Mario, players rotate ""pill"" pieces as they fall, attempting to clear their screen without spilling over the top. Each stage has a specific number of viruses that must be eliminated instead of simply playing until you die. Each falling block is composed of two colored pieces, and lining up four or more of the same color (either horizontally or vertically) will zap them from your screen. The idea, of course, is to try and make sure you take one of those ugly virus blobs with you as you stack the colors. Once all the viruses have been cleared, players move on to the next stage -- featuring more viruses and faster pieces.

The Rainbow team is once again called on to squelch terrorist operations in this follow-up to the original RAINBOW SIX. A seemingly unrelated series of terrorist acts begins to jell together as the Rainbow team uncovers more and more about the dark force wreaking global havoc. Following the detailed instructions of Mr. Clark, you will lead your team against a sly lot of bad guys, planning secret operatives and using your best guerilla strategies. Unlike most action games, you have to plan out ahead of time which team members will perform which tasks; while you're distracting a terrorist, your pals might be breaking in through the back entrance. This installment boasts a whole new bunch of weapons, including three sniper rifles and several new assault rifles. Of course, almost all of the action requires brains more than it does brawn, so you'll have to use the utmost stealth in trying out the new firepower. Featuring 18 distinct missions, Rogue Spear lets you replay each quest in either Lone Wolf mode (you traverse the map solo) or Terrorist Hunt (you try to blow away as many bad guys as possible). There's also a Watch mode, which lets you plan out all of the action then sit back and watch your team go jumping in only when you feel it's necessary.

Pinobee: Wings of Adventure	http://www.ign.com/games/pinobee-wings-of-adventure/gba-15378	Pinobee: Wings of Adventure takes full advantage of Game Boy Advance's 32-bit color graphics. From Pinobee's fluid animation to the detailed environments he explores, it's obvious that a lot of spit and polish has been applied to this Pak. Pinobee screenshots may lead you to believe that this is a standard action platform game, but that is far from an accurate description. Pinobee can walk along the ground or shimmy up walls, but his main means of locomotion is dashing through the air. As he makes it deeper in his quest, Pinobee gains the ability to dash farther and farther through the air. Soon enough, he's spending more time hovering and dashing through the sky than on the ground. This unique play control system gives Pinobee a fresh feel.	http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-3/gba-497892,http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-world/gba-16931,http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/gba-482090,http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion/gba-16227,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-emerald-version/gba-692344,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version/gba-17508	Platformer	GBA	6.0	Okay	5.9	Mediocre	Hudson Soft	Artoon	E for Everyone	Animated Violence	June 11, 2001	39.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165378p1.html

Lending his expertise to the creation of this game, Hoffman makes sure that every turn, ramp, and flip is up to snuff. Stunt biking has never been more exciting, as you choose from a list of professional BMX riders and see what magic you can make to out-duel the competition.

Jim's arsenal is a bit on the skimpy side, although in the annals of video games the sight of an oversized annelid cracking his own head like a bullwhip is surely unique.

Castlevania: Circle of the Moon	http://www.ign.com/games/castlevania-circle-of-the-moon/gba-15396	Gamers have been enjoying Castlevania's eerie storylines since 1987, and the latest version of Castlevania for Game Boy Advance is one of the very best in the series.  Powered by Game Boy Advance's 32-bit color graphics, Circle of the Moon looks great and sounds even better. The haunting music tracks and awesome sound effects are some of the greatest audio treats we've ever heard on a portable system. Turn down the sound on this one and you'll be losing a great deal of the gloomy atmosphere which is crucial to the Castlevania experience.  Circle of the Moon relies heavily on the platform-jumping skeleton-whipping formula which led to Castlevania's initial success, but Konami has created some new gameplay elements which add to its depth. Instead of simply working your way from point A to point B in Dracula's castle, you can choose your own route through branching passageways and corridors. The gameplay is mostly linear, but you'll definitely make a few wrong turns before figuring out where you're supposed to go next.	http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion/gba-16227,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-minish-cap/gba-499614,http://www.ign.com/games/dragon-ball-z-the-legacy-of-goku/gba-17519,http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion/gba-16227,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-minish-cap/gba-499614,http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-zero-mission/gba-566746,http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion/gba-16227,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-emerald-version/gba-692344,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version/gba-17508	Action	GBA Wii U	9.0	Amazing	8.7	Great	Konami	Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe (KCEK)	T for Teen	Mild Animated Violence	June 11, 2001	12.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165396p1.html

World Series Baseball 2K2	http://www.ign.com/games/world-series-baseball-2k2/dc-16539	The developer of the acclaimed Sega Sports games NBA 2K2 and NFL 2K2 steps up to the plate one final time on the Dreamcast, attempting to bring some of that 2K2 magic to America's national pastime. WSB2K2 boasts some of the best visuals seen in a baseball game to date, with real player models and stances that mimic those of real MLB stars. All the stadiums are here as well. The game engine has been updated from WSB2K1, the pitcher-batter interface has been tweaked, and a new manual fielding option should please those who griped about poor fielder AI in the first game. WSB2K2 also featues an updated roster and a new franchise mode. Online play is supported and you are ranked by your wins and losses. Not quite the home run it was hyped to be, it's still the best baseball the Dreamcast has to offer!	http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/dc-14676,http://www.ign.com/games/world-series-baseball-2k1/dc-13023,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967	Sports	DC	8.7	Great	8.2	Great	SEGA, Visual Concepts	Blue Shift, Exile Interactive	E for Everyone	null	August 15, 2001	39.99 USD	http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/166/166539p1.html

It begins with several missions surrounding an attempt by the Russians to secure a beachhead. At this stage, you'll need to strike enemy ships and intercept incoming cruise missiles. Once the Russians do gain a footing you'll need to fly missions involving bomber interception and ground support.

Selection is a top-selling point with THE LAST BLADE 2, as the title offers you 16 fighters from the outset. Each hand-illustrated character brings a vastly different set of skills to the table, making each match-up a unique encounter. You choose whether you want your brawler to specialize in power, speed, or a combination of the two more powerful characters can inflict serious damage with one or two blows, while the speedier combatants are more readily able to avoid attacks and string together wicked combos. Choosing the combination of speed and power gives you unbelievable offensive skills, but saddles you with the burden of operating with less stamina. The 2D graphics hearken back to old-school arena fighters, but the gameplay is as advanced as any console game in circulation. Throw in some truly awesome multiplayer action, and you've got what can only be classified as the next generation of hand-to-hand combat.	http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967,http://www.ign.com/games/soulcalibur/dc-10953,http://www.ign.com/games/ultimate-fighting-championship/dc-14160,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967	Fighting	DC NGCD Wii NG Vita Arcade PS4	8.7	Great	8.2	Great	Agetec	SNK [1978-2001]	T for Teen	Violence	August 8, 2001	36.99 USD	http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/166/166649p1.html

Gallop Racer 2001	http://www.ign.com/games/gallop-racer-2001/ps2-16661	There's more to thoroughbred racing than horses running fast.  There's also how well the horse handles inclines, whether it prefers to run mid-pack early in the race or to take the lead right away, its age, how well it performs on different track surfaces, and its general temperament. And let's not forget the time before and between races -- even horses need good managers.gives players the opportunity to deal with all the ins and outs of horse racing, making it as much of sim as it is a racing game. In Season mode, you play dual roles. As a stable owner, you will choose which horses run which races, decide when to retire horses, make breeding selections, and even name the foals. As jockey, you direct your horse during the races, but its performance will ultimately depend on its temperament and how well you've handled your other duties. There is also a two-player splitscreen Versus mode.	http://www.ign.com/games/the-sims-1/ps2-17231,http://www.ign.com/games/the-sims-bustin-out/ps2-566345,http://www.ign.com/games/playboy-the-mansion/ps2-497001,http://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/ps2-14241813,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-811719,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-888576	Simulation	PS2	7.9	Good	8.1	Great	Tecmo	Tecmo	E for Everyone	Gambling	August 21, 2001	24.99 USD	http://ps2.ign.com/articles/166/166661p1.html

Trouballs	http://www.ign.com/games/trouballs-167949/gbc-15976	If you're ready for explosive, mind-twisting puzzle-action mayhem then grab a copy of TROUBALLS from Capcom. In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it's up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here's how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You'll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels. If you couldn't get enough of TETRIS or BUST-A-MOVE, then you'll love TROUBALLS to pieces.	http://www.ign.com/games/tonka-construction-site/gbc-662099,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-puzzle-challenge/gbc-13800,http://www.ign.com/games/shanghai-pocket/gbc-10787,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version/gbc-16709,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version/gbc-12865,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-crystal-version/gbc-15402	Puzzle	GBC	7.0	Good	6.4	Okay	Capcom	Paragon 5	E for Everyone	No Descriptors	October 5, 2001	3.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165976p1.html

Dante has inherited heroism from his ancestors, and along with it, vampiric genes, to boot.

Dante can shoot with guns and slash with several kinds of swords, but he's also able to transform into a hovering nightmare that's even more powerful. As Dante progresses through the game, he unearths numerous weapons (including his dual-pistols and shotguns), and powerful swords, each possessing various elemental powers. Among the enemies Dante fights are the low-class Demonic (which normally are slow but fight surprisingly fast), the grim-reaper like Death, which hover in air and travel through walls, and attack with scissors-like weapons and scythes, and the high-level castle rulers, the Phantoms.	http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-811719,http://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts/ps2-16467,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/ps2-611957,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-811719,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/ps2-611957,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war/ps2-661321,http://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/ps2-14241813,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-811719,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-888576	Action	PS2	9.6	Amazing	9.0	Amazing	Capcom	Capcom Production Studio 4	M for Mature	Blood, Violence	October 17, 2001	19.99 USD	http://ps2.ign.com/articles/165/165620p1.html

Looney Tunes: Sheep Raider	http://www.ign.com/games/looney-tunes-sheep-raider/ps-14588	Based on the hilarious stories of a somewhat obscure classic Warner Bros. cartoon, SHEEP RAIDER marks the re-emergence of Sam Sheepdog and Ralph Wolf.

The game is formatted in the style of a game show, and the inimitable Daffy Duck is playing host. You'll play as the sneaky Ralph, and most of the game's levels revolve around capturing sheep. It's not as simple as it sounds. One level has you jet-packing about, while another requires you to collect a series of gadgets that you'll use to make a giant rubber band eventually repelling from a cliff to pull off your heist. The rubber band later reappears as part of a sheep slingshot that you'll have to construct between two trees. Boasting top-shelf cartoon graphics and tons of original gameplay, SHEEP RAIDER is a brilliant retread of a truly great animated series.	http://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot/ps-603,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot-warped/ps-3919,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot-2-cortex-strikes-back/ps-2037,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Platformer	PS PC	8.0	Great	8.5	Great	Infogrames	Lyon House	E for Everyone	Comic Mischief	August 2001	19.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/164/164588p1.html

Castlevania Chronicles	http://www.ign.com/games/castlevania-chronicles/ps-16263	One of the most heralded home console games of all-time has returned for more vampire-slaying excitement. The game's popularity reached unparalleled worldwide proportions when, in 1993, a version of the game was released exclusively on the Japanese Sharp X68000 personal computer. Now, that version (called DRACULA X68000 in Japan) finally makes its way to domestic shores with this port for the PlayStation. It bears a striking resemblance to the first CASTLEVANIA titles, but this version boasts lots of new villains and additional levels. As with previous installments, the game requires you to move through 2D levels as vampire hunter, Simon Belmont. Using various weaponry, you'll try to defeat all of your attackers before they get the best of you. Improved graphics and expanded gameplay give this installment an edge on its predecessors, and you can actually tweak the audio and video presentation this time around.

Gadget Racers	http://www.ign.com/games/gadget-racers/gba-16785	Sometime in the 1980s, the Japanese Choro-Q Racing toys made their way to U.S. shores. Renamed Penny Racers for the benefit of American sales, the wind-up cars were built to perform different tricks (wheelies and spins, mostly) when a penny was inserted into their chassis. The plastic racers are still very popular in Japan, inspiring a video game called CHORO-Q ADVANCE. The U.S. release of the game is called GADGET RACERS, and it's every bit as exciting as the toys that it's based on. Command any of 50 unique vehicles through 40 different courses of obstacles, tricks, and general mayhem. You can customize your racer to meet your specifications, using more than 130 different parts to soup things up upgrade your tires, brakes, steering, engines, and more. Adding to the excitement is the fact that you can get four players competing for glory via a link cable and for Game Boy Advance consoles. It's a mystery why the toys no longer roam the bedroom floors of American households, but maybe this awesome video game will create a resurgence.	http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-super-circuit/gba-15249,http://www.ign.com/games/moto-racer-advance/gba-482173,http://www.ign.com/games/disney-sports-motocross/gba-490740,http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion/gba-16227,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-emerald-version/gba-692344,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version/gba-17508	Racing	GBA GCN PS2	7.0	Good	7.5	Good	Conspiracy Entertainment	Takara	E for Everyone	null	October 2001	19.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/166/166785p1.html

Now, the dastardly pair has embarked on a plot to sink the entire island, and you'll have to train an army of Dragon Warrior Monsters to help stop the evil crime. This installment casts you as the brother, Cobi challenging you to find hidden keys and prepare all of your monsters for battle. There are more than 300 battling beasts in all, which means that you'll have your work cut out for you if you hope to effectively utilize your troops. As you wander through the land, you'll encounter different monsters, which you can persuade to join your team by offering up treats. You can also trade beings with other players who own the game or have a copy of DRAGON WARRIOR MONSTERS 2: Tara's Adventure (the parallel release, which follows the story of Cobi's sister).	http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version/gbc-16709,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version/gbc-12865,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-crystal-version/gbc-15402,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version/gbc-16709,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version/gbc-12865,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-crystal-version/gbc-15402	RPG	GBC	9.0	Amazing	9.0	Amazing	Enix	Enix	E for Everyone	Mild Animated Violence	September 2001	36.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/166/166868p1.html

But every virtual adventurer knows that it's never as simple as that, and eventually you're thrust into the role of the world's savior, befriending other skilled adventurers that will join your crusade...there's strength in numbers, as the phrase goes.	http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-emerald-version/gba-692344,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version/gba-17508,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-firered-version/gba-605909,http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion/gba-16227,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-emerald-version/gba-692344,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version/gba-17508	Turn-Based, RPG	GBA Wii U	9.7	Amazing	9.1	Amazing	Nintendo	Camelot Software Planning	E for Everyone	Mild Violence	November 2001	14.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165255p1.html

With the help of the Fuzzles, big-toothed fuzzballs used for product testing, Munch escapes, meets up with Abe, and together they set out to stop the Glukkons at their game... not to mention win back the last can of Gabbiar -- Gabbit eggs -- in the world.	http://www.ign.com/games/call-of-cthulhu-dark-corners-of-the-earth/xbox-496019,http://www.ign.com/games/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/xbox-735105,http://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell/xbox-481175,http://www.ign.com/games/halo-2/xbox-482228,http://www.ign.com/games/halo-combat-evolved/xbox-15922,http://www.ign.com/games/fable/xbox-16526	Adventure	Xbox GBA Vita PS3 PS2 Xbox 360 PC	7.4	Good	7.9	Good	Microsoft	Oddworld Inhabitants	T for Teen	Comic Mischief, Violence	November 09, 2001	19.99 USD	http://xbox.ign.com/articles/165/165524p1.html

Harry's got his own book series, a feature film directed by Steven Spielberg, and now his very own video game for the PlayStation. Based on J.K.

You'll begin as a first-year student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry; eventually perfecting your skills to the point where you can venture out into the real world and try a few things out. There are plenty of popular characters to keep young gamers as enthralled as they were by the books (Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Draco Malfoy among others are all here), and there's an encounter at the end of the game with a not-so-friendly face from the story. The game is packed with tons of magic, secrets, power-ups and hidden goodies for kids to seek out, and the graphics do the story justice.	http://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill/ps-3982,http://www.ign.com/games/dino-crisis/ps-11235,http://www.ign.com/games/oddworld-abes-oddysee/ps-2094,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673	Adventure	PS GBC Xbox GCN Mac PC GBA PS2	8.0	Great	7.5	Good	Electronic Arts	Argonaut Games	E for Everyone	Comic Mischief, Mild Violence	November 11, 2001	28.99 USD	http://psx.ign.com/articles/166/166595p1.html

Eisenhower ordered Major Quintin Maxwell, the Army's leading expert on commando/unconventional warfare, to form a small special operations group to be designated as the 1st Special Missions Unit.  After 12 weeks of intense training under Major Maxwell, this group of twelve hardcases were forged into an elite fighting force capable of taking on any mission, no matter how impossible, and succeeding.

Play as Ulysses (the character that Charlton Heston originated), a human who has fallen to a post-apocalyptic Earth ruled by primates. Ulysses quickly discovers that he is being considered a sort of messiah by many of the apes (he's considered an enemy by others), and it is becoming readily apparent that the creatures want him to save them from the dangers of this new world. The game is packed with puzzles to solve, and the graphics are among the best ever created for the Game Boy Color. Modes of play include: Normal, in which Ulysses walks from location to location; Athletic, in which the hero runs and jumps through each level of the story; and Stealth, which requires Ulysses to crawl and slink into hidden areas not accessible in other modes. It's not easy to compare PLANET OF THE APES to any other video game, and that's really its charm.	http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-oracle-of-seasons/gbc-16042,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-oracle-of-ages/gbc-16041,http://www.ign.com/games/batman-chaos-in-gotham/gbc-14474,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version/gbc-16709,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version/gbc-12865,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-crystal-version/gbc-15402	Action	GBC DC PC GBA PS	6.0	Okay	5.0	Mediocre	Ubisoft	Torus Games	E for Everyone	Realistic Violence	TBA 2002	36.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/167/167112p1.html

As General Manager (GM), your job is to build the best lineup of players to take your team to the Championship Series.

If your new players are good enough, have them join your team right away, otherwise send them to your minor league franchise for training and improvement. Then, as the season progresses you choose which players stay in the big leagues, which ones get sent down to the minors, and which ones get released or traded.	http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k17/pc-20052300,http://www.ign.com/games/pro-evolution-soccer-2017/pc-20054110,http://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k17/pc-20063609,http://www.ign.com/games/mechwarrior-online/pc-18954,http://www.ign.com/games/stardew-valley/pc-20001247,http://www.ign.com/games/omerta-city-of-gangsters-134706/pc-129676,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505	Sports	PC	8.7	Great	8.0	Great	Sports Mogul	Sports Mogul	E for Everyone	null	Apr 1, 2001	24.99 USD	http://pc.ign.com/articles/167/167488p1.html

Rampage: Puzzle Attack	http://www.ign.com/games/rampage-puzzle-attack/gba-17146	The RAMPAGE series takes a puzzling turn in this dazzling installment of the time-honored monster franchise. Classic beasts like George, Lizzie, and Ralph are along for all of the excitement, although there's none of the building-smashing action that RAMPAGE fans have grown accustomed to here. Much like TETRIS, the object of RAMPAGE PUZZLE ATTACK is to arrange a bunch of colored blocks as they fall from the sky. You'll be able to adjust the blocks by rotating them, and the hope is to create solid lines of like-colored blocks thus, causing those lines to disappear. The pieces begin to fall faster and faster as the gameplay progresses, so make sure you bring your reflexes and your thinking cap for this experience! Several modes of play keep the replay value high, and you can even save your progress with a password. Play alone or use a link cable to challenge a friend to a head-to-head match-up.	http://www.ign.com/games/barbie-superpack/gba-490732,http://www.ign.com/games/tweety-and-the-magic-gems/gba-15444,http://www.ign.com/games/super-monkey-ball-jr/gba-480095,http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion/gba-16227,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-emerald-version/gba-692344,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version/gba-17508	Puzzle	GBA	8.5	Great	7.8	Good	Midway  Games	Ninai Games	E for Everyone	null	December 2001	7.99 USD	http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/167/167146p1.html

Darkened Skye	http://www.ign.com/games/darkened-skye/pc-16182	A real-time action/adventure game for teens and adults based around several of the popular and enigmatic Skittles: Taste the Rainbow fantasy television commercials. It features a level-based, third-person-shooter style of design, but also includes a rich story line and a healthy dose of adventure game-type puzzles. Skye, our heroine, fights and puzzles her way through 30 real-time levels. Gameplay within each level is open-ended, free-roaming and non-linear. Magic takes the place of high-tech weaponry in the frequent combat encounters, while cutting-edge humor replaces blood and gore. The game is rendered in beautiful, high fantasy style and the quest is serious but Skye and her companion, a mouthy little gargoyle named Draak, make a steady stream of irreverent observations that poke fun at gaming cliches, themselves and their hopeless quest.	http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-5/pc-20023125,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-7/pc-20054862,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-7/pc-20054862,http://www.ign.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider/pc-20020150,http://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-black-flag/pc-159976,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505	Action	PC PS2 GCN GCN	7.0	Good	7.5	Good	Simon & Schuster Interactive	Boston Animation	T for Teen	Blood, Violence	Jan 25, 2002	19.99 USD	http://pc.ign.com/articles/324/324634p1.html
